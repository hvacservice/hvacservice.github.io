<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Olean NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such elements include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide released by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
