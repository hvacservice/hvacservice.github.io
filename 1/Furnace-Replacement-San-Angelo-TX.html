<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

While some problems are triggered by regular wear and tear, many can be traced to inconsistent maintenance.
