<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal.
