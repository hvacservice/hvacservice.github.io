<p>The main reason house owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a maker's warranty. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some makers need regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a luxury item and more like a need.
