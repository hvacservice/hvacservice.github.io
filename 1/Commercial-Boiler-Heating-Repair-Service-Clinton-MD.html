<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Clinton MD</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
