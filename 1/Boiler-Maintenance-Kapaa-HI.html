<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
