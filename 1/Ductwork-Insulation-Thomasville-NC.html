<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
