<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
