<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need reasonably little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems need to be checked a minimum of twice each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be positioned. The majority of commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're trying to track you'll require to position the sensing unit appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
