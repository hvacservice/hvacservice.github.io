<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
