<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
