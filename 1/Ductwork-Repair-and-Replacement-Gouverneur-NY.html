<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
