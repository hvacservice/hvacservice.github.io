<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

Kids might have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
