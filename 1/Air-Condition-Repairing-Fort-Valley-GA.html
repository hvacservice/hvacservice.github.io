<p>. Before selecting the installation place of a/c, a number of main aspects require to be considered. First of all, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Second of all, there must not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that may avoid it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outside unit should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop dramatically.

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
