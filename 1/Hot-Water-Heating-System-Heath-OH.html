<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
