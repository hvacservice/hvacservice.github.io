What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
