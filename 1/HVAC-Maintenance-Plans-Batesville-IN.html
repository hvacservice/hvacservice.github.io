<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve).

If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
