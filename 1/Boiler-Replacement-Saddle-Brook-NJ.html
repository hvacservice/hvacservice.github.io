<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
