<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
