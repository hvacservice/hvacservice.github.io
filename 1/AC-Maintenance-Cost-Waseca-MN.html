<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
