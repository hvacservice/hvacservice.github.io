<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
