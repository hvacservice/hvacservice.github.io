<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
