<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Collins MS 39428</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit truthful, enjoyable and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was amazing, helpful and useful - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were polite and conscientious. The work website was left absolutely cleared and cleaned. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered exceptional, individualized, mindful, and quality service. His communication style is friendly, efficient and appealing. He plainly and thoroughly discussed all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the first go to due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
