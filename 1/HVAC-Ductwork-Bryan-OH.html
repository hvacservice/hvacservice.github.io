<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use.

Heating systems that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
