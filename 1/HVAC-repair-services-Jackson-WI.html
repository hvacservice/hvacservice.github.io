<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
