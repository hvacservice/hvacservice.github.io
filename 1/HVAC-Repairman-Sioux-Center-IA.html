<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be put. Most frequently they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if individuals mainly remain seated in that particular area.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
