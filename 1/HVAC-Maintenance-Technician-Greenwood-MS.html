The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than lots of heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the design you acquire. One of the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating choices.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
