But ducts that are not installed correctly or kept can distribute impurities from one space to another. Over time, dust, dander and even mold can collect in your ducts, minimizing the general air quality. Hire an expert to make sure your ducts are flowing fresh, tidy air.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work.

No extra charge.<p>
