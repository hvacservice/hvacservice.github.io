<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
