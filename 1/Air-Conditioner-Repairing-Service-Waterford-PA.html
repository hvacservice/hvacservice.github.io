<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth does not necessarily translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The ventilation, air and heating conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather shows up, need heats up throughout the summer and winter season.<p>
