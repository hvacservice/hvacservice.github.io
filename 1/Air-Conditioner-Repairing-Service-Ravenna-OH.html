<p>Structures are created or planned to react actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and maintain surface areas to improve their durability, appearance, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even dramatically change structures in manner ins which may be necessary to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, some of the approaches utilized by researchers studying environments, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering details on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
