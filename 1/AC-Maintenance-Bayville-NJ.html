<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
