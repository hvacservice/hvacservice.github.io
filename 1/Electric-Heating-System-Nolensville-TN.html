<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne.
