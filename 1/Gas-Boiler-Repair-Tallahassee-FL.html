<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
