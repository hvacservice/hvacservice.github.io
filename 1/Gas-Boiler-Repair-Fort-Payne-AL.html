<p>We look at ideas before we provide guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company.

Evaluation of this data may recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
