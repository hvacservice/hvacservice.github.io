<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
