These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>While toxin levels from private sources may not pose a substantial health risk on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
