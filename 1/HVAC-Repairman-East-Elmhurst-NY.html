<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, given that it considers not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside is associated with a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
