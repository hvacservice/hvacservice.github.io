<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have.
