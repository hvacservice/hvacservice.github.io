<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
