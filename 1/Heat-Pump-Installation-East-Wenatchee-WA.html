<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
