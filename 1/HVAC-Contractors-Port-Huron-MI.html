<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
