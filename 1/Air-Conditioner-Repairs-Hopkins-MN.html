<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy.

<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
