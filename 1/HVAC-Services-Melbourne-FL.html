<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an important problem to house owners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination research studies have identified several pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the instant symptoms that some people have experienced not long after direct exposure to some organics.

<p>Many individuals undervalue the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is typically pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the home. To intensify the problem, it is estimated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time indoors, and over half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized different approaches. The CMHC study called on a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they belonged to a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or methods used. The EPA research study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered given that these studies were carried out, the duct in homes haven't.<p>
