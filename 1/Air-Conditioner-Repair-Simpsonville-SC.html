<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Simpsonville South Carolina</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning system is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's a basic issue like particles blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those elements may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up new machinery.<p>
<p>Even with the right system and appropriate installation, there's constantly the possibility that your furnace will malfunction. While some issues are triggered by regular wear and tear, many can be traced to irregular maintenance. Furnace problems can create chaos in your home, particularly during the colder months when you truly need to heat your interior. It's useful to understand how to troubleshoot typical concerns so you can decide what to look after yourself and what to let a professional manage.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
