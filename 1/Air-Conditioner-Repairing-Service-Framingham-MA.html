<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>There are many reasons that this can occur. Fortunately is that you can resolve many of these factors on your own without the requirement to require professional assistance. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that carry on to inspecting the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can also check the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
