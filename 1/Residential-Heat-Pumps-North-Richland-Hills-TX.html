<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
