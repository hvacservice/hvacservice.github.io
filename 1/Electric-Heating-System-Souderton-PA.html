<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
