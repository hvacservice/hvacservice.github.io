<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
