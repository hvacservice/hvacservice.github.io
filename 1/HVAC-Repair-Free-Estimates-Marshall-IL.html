<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
