<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
