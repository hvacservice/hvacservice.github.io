<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
