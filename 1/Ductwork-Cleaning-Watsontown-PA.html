<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.
