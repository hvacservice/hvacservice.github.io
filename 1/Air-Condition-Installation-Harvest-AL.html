<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
