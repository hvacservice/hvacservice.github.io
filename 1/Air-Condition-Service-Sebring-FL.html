<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still warms to the right temperature level.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must contact a specialist to examine and repair the system.<p>
