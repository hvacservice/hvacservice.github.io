<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
