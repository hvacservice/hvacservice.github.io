<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
