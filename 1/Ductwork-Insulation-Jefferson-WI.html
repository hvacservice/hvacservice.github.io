<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently.
