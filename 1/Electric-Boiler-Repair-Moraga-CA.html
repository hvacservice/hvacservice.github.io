<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
