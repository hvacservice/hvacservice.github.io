What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

This is an outstanding opportunity to identify parts that are used or faulty. Changing them to repair the cooling may be a lot less costly when the problem is fairly minor.<p>
