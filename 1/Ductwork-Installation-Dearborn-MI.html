<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
