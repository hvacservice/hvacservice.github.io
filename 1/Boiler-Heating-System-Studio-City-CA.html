<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The early couple of years of your organisation are an amazing time, and it's appealing to let pure interest direct your path forward. But if you desire your brand-new HVAC organisation to have staying power, you must step back and devote the necessary time to developing a business strategy. And remember that a company plan for an HVAC company isn't indicated to be a fixed file. It's a structure to assist the launch or revamp of your organisation that you can build upon and restructure as the business develops.<p>
