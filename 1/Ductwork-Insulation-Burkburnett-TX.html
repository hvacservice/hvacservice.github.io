<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
