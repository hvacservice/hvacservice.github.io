<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
