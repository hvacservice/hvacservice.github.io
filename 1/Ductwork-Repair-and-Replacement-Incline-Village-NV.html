<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
