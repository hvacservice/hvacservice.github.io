<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
