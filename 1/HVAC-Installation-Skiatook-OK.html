<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
