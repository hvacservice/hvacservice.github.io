<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it may simply need to be cleaned up. Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's a good early remedy to try. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever utilize a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are standards; always refer to your owner's manual. Keep in mind: Always turn off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
