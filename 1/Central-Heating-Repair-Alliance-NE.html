<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
