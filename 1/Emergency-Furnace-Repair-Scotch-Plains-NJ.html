<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
