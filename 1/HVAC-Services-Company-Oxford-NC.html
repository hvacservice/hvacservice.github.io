<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can likewise result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked within, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>A/c can produce a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many people.<p>
