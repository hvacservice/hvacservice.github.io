<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
