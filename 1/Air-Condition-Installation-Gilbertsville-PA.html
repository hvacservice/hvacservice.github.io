<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
