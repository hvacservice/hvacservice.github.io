Improperly located outdoor air intake vents can also generate air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
