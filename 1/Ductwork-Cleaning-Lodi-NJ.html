<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
