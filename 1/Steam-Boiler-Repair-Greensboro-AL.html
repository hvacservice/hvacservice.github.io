<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
