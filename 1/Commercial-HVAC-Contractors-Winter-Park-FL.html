<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
