<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
