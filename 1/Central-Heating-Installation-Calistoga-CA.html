<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores. The main threat of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall.

PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While room a/c provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
