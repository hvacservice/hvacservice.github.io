<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
