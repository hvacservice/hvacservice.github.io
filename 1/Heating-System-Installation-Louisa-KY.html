Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2).
