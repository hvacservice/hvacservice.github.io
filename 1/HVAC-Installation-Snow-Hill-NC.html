This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outside metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.
