<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
