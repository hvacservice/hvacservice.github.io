<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be performed in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
