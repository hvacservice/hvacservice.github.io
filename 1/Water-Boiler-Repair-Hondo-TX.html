On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. Because they heat surface areas and not the air itself, in-floor heating unit are not susceptible to this concern.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
