<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
