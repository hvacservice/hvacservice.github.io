<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Bainbridge Island WA</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run constantly is since something is blocked or filthy Before attempting to fix any issue, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is good to go, inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
