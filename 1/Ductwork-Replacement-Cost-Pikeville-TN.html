<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
