Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
