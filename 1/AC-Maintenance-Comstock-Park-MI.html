<h3>Truth About Comstock Park MI Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins emitted by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
