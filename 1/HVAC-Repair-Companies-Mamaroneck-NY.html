<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
