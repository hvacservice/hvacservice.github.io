<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain due to the fact that they only partly remove the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon entering the home. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reliable means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Considering that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective.
