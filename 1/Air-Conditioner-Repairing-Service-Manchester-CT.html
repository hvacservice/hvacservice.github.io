<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heater) with the same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
