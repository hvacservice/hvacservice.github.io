<p>Details offered in this safety guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings constantly evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the residents, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing somewhat in time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, collects dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
