<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
