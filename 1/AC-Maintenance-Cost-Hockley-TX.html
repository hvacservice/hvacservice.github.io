<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
