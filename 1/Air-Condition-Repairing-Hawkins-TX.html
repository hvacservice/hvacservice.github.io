Some buildings can likewise utilize natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air presented into a space per a system of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient.
