Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
