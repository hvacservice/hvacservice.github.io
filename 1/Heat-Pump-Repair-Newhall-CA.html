<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not have the ability to cool your house appropriately.
