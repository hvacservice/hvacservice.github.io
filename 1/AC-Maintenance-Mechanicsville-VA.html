<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in Mechanicsville VA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
