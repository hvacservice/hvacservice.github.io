<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
