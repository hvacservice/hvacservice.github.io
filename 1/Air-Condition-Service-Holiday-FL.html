<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>To set up a safe assessment or appointment with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your location in an online search. Message or call professionals to ask whether they can carry out a consultation over the phone or even over a video call. In this manner, they can examine the issue without increasing the threat of virus transmission by visiting your house.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
