<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one action mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
