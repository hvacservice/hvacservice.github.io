<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
