<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
