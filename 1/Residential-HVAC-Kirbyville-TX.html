A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only factor for high bills. Heaters often lose their performance as they age, particularly if they have not been correctly maintained. As an outcome your oil or gas furnace may run longer to supply the very same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy expenses to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be utilized to help you pay for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
