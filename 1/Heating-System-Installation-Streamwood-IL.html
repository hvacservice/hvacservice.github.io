<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>

This can result in the potential for substantial health problems.<p>
