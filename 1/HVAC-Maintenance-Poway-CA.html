<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged.

<p>Old heating systems typically begin to make some unusual sounds as they get toward the end of their life.
