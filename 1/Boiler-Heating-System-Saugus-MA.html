<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
