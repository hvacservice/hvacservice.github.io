<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
