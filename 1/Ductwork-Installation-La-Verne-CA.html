<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.. an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
