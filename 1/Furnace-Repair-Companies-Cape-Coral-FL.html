<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air conditioning unit. In fact, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong recommendation not to do so. Expect to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to set up central air if you do take our recommendation. Furthermore, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for extra products and equipment.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a service or seller to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the cooling system. A voided service warranty will not do you any excellent should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and employ a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
