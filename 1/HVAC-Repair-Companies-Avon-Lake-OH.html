<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Avon Lake OH 44012</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
