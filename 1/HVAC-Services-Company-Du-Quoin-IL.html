<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
