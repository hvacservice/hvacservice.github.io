One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand existing, which then produces heat.<p>

<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
