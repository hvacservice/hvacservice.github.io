<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
