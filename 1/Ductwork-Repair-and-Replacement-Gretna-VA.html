<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri.
