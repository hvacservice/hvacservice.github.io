Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
