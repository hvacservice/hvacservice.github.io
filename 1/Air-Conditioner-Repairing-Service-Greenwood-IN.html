<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
