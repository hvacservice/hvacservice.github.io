Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
