<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
