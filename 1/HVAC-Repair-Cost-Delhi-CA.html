<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
