<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
