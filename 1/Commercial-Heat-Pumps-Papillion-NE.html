<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
