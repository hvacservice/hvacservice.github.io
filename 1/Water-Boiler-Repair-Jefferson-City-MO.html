<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.

<h3>Benefits of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Jefferson City MO</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you work with to install your central air system. In fact, you can even DIY, in spite of our strong suggestion not to do so.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
