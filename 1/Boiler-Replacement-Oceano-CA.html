<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other work environments is important not only for workers' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, tiredness, problem concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some particular diseases have been connected to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with moist indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs however can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids might have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
