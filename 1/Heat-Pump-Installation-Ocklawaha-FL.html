<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a moderate climate, where the temperature does not get too low or too high.
