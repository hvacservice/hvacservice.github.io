<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Harlem GA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
