<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
