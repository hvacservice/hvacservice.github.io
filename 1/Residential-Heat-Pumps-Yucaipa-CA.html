If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, figuring out the correct size of system for your house also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
