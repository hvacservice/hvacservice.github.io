<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.

Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
