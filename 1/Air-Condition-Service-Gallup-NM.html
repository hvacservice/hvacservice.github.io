<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
