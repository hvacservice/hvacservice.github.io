<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
