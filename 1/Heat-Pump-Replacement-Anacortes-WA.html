Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family house installation organisation completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living.

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
