<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can normally be done in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
