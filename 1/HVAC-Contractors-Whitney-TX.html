<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Compounding the noted health signs may be job tension. In part, due to numerous aspects of workplace automation, the most demanding aspects of office work are increasing.
