<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
