<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, gas, or coal. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal cooling and heating system uses substantially less electricity compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an appealing option to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or common household a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
