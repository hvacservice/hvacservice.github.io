<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
