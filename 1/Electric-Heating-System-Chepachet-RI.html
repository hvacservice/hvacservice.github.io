<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
