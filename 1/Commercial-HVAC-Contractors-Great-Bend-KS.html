<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
