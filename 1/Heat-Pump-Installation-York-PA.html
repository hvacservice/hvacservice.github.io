Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
