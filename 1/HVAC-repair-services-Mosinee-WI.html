Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio.
