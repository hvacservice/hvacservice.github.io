<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and structure residents may be exposed to a variety of impurities (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning products, building and construction carpets, activities and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside toxins.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
