<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. Due to the fact that they just partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home, the efficiency of these devices is unsure.
