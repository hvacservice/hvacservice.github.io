<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
