It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
