<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution. If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>It is not useful to create a universal guideline suitable for all in terms of direct exposure and health since resistance varies greatly from specific to individual. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a ten years research study analyzing more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 ecological samples that were collected across the United States and abroad. The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples analyzed were tested favorable for fungi and bacteria.<p>
