<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

The companies were not warned they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or methods utilized. The EPA study recommended and controlled methods used on a smaller number of houses.

And although the devices and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered because these research studies were conducted, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or typical household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it.

<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
