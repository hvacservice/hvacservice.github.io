PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
