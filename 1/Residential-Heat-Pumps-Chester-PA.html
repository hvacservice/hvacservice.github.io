<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
