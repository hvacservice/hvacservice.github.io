<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in Ball Ground GA</h3>
<p>The company's head workplace is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they distribute their item in all areas in South Africa and neighboring nations, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
