EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in gathering info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
