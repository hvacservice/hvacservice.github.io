Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
