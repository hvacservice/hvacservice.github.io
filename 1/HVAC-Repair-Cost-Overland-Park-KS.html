<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
