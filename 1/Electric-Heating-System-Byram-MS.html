This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
