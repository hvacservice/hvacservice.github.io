<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
