<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
