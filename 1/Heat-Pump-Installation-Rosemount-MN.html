<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
