<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden seem higher than regular, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses immediately, not to mention the cash you'll minimize repair expenses. If your heating unit is 25 years old or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>

All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
