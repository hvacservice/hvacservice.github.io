<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
