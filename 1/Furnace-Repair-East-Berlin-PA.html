<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in East Berlin Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health danger factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new resident I have learned how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
