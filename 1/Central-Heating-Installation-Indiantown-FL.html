When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
