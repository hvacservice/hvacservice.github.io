<h3>Suggestions to Avoid Furnace Repairing Costs in Sherwood OR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
