<p>A geothermal heat pump is also a really safe heating and cooling option, because it does not need any kind of combustion, unlike alternatives. This makes the WaterFurnace geothermal system a much better alternative for those who are worried about security, both in terms of people and the environment, with geothermal services offering an environmentally friendly energy source for heating and cooling houses.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump generally need excavation to set up, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
