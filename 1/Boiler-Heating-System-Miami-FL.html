<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the harmful impacts of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems need to be inspected at least twice each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
