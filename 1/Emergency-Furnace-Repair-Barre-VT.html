<p>There are two primary types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to withstand existing, which then generates heat.<p>
