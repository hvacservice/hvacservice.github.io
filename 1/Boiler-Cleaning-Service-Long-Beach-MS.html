Left unattended, these concerns can cause loss of effectiveness and even worse, breakdown of element materials and a shorter furnace life expectancy With time, important parts like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start corroding, resulting in lowered performance.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
