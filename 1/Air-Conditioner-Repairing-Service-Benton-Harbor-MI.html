<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up.
