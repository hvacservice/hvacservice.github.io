<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Tremonton UT</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
