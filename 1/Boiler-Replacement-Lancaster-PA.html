<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>Every personal residence and small business needs the services of experienced service technicians trained in the installation, maintenance, and repair of air conditioning, refrigeration, and heating unit. The Residential HVAC Service Technician certificate opens numerous doors of opportunity for HGTC graduates.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
