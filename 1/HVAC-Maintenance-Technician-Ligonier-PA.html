<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
