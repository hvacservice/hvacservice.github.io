<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
