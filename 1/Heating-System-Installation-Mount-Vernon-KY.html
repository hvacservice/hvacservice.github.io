<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
