<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
