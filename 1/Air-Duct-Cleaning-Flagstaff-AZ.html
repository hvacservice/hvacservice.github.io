<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
