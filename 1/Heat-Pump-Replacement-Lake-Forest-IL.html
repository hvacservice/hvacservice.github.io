<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must also be examined frequently. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire threat. Disconnected fuel lines can compromise the efficiency of the HVAC system too. Soot can build up in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an effect on the system's effectiveness as well. The maintenance. service technicians will evaluate all of these elements of the furnace and carefully and remove all clogs and traces of soot.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
