<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
