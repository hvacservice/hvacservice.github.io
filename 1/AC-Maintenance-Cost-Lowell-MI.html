<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>The most common type of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive option, however newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective gas heating systems can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
