<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with issues. I would advise this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
