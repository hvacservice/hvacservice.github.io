<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
