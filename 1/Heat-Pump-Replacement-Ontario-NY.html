<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
