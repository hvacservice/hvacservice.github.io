<h3>Furnace Replacement in Ellenwood Georgia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
