<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales male pertains to your home he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
