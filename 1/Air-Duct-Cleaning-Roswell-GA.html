<p>Given that pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is sensible to minimize making use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside. Depending on the site and insect to be managed, one or more of the following steps can be reliable: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be reduced or avoided by ensuring that wooden structure materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by saving fire wood away from the home. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be dramatically minimized.<p>
