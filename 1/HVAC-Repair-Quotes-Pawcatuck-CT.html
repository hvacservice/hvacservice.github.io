<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Pawcatuck Connecticut</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry.

It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
