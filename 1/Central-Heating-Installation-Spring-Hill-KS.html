<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize performance and provide longer enduring home heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can determine an issue that will require a substantial investment to treat. Then, it's decision time.

The choice to change or repair depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides greater energy performance and comes with service warranty coverage.<p>
