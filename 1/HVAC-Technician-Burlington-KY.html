<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Burlington KY 41005</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the very low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will simply run harder to keep a warm climate for your home when the weather condition is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you require clarity on this concern, contact one of our professionals.<p>
