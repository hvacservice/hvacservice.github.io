<p>Brian was every bit truthful, enjoyable and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, helpful and useful - his work was flawless! All of his assistants were diligent and courteous. The work site was left entirely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
