<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
