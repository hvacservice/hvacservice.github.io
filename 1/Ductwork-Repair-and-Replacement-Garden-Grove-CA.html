<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
