Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
