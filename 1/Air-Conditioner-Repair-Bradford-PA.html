<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
