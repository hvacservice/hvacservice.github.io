<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
