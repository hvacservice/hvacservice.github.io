Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
