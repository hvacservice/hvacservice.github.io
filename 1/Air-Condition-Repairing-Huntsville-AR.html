<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
