<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
