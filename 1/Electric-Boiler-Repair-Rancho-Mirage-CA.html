<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
