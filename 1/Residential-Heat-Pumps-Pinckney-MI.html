<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
