<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
