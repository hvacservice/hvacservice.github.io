<p>Enhance your services, make more services income, and provide a remarkable consumer experience. To ensure the system you choose is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the specific kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the very same size system you presently have. These estimations take into consideration things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is vital so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
