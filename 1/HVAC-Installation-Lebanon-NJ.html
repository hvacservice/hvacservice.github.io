<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
