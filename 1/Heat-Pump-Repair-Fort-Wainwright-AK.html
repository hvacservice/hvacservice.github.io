<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and efficiency of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>

However, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to employ a professional to repair the unit and inspect.<p>
