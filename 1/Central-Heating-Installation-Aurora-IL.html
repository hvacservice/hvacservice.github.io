<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Aurora IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are turned off to mitigate further temperature level drops; clarification needed this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room. citation needed When the temperature increases again, clarification required the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
