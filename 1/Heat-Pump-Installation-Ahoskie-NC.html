<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
