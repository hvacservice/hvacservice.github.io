<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
