<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating System in Reidsville NC 27320</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has actually carried out. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These examinations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
