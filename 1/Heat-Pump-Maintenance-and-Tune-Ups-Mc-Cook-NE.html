<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air path. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
