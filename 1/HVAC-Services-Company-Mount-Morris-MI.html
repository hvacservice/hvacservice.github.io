<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your house is located, the local region's environment can alter drastically. A house situated in the South would need an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would require a much bigger heating capacity also which will impact expenses. See the chart listed below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOADS.<p>
