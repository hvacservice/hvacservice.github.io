<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>I have used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance contract which covers two services every year. Ilan has been great through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he notifies me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Extremely delighted with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>
