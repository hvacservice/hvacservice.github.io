These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Homes can have the very same indoor air problems as single-family houses because much of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and home items, are comparable.
