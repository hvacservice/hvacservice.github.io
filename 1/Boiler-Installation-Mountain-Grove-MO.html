<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
