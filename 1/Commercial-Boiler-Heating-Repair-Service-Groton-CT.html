<p>Your concerns or issues about indoor air problems can frequently be addressed by the government firms in your state or city government. Duties for indoor air quality concerns are typically divided among many different agencies. Calling or composing the firms responsible for health or air quality control is the best way to start getting details from your state or city government. To obtain state company contacts, call or write EPA's IAQ Details Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
