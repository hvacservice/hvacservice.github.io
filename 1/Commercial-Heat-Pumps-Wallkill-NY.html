<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are hardly ever used due to long-lasting corrosive issues. Essentially all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, will not rust and can be found in long lengths, which enable PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
