<p>To start, it's a great concept to think of energy efficiency. By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Performance rankings must be labeled with all systems. While efficient units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated home appliance is a great method to delight in additional peace of mind.<p>
<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality issue is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate issues-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three techniques listed below may be proper.<p>
