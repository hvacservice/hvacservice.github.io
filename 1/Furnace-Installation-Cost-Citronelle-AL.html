<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
