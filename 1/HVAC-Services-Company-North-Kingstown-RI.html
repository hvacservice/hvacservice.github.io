<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
