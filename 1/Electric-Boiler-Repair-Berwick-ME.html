<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Berwick ME 03901</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
