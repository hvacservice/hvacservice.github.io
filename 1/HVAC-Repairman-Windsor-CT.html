<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Windsor CT</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These aspects include poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues managing temperature level, high or low humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. Often, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas over time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
