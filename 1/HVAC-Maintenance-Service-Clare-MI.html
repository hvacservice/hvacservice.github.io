<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Clare MI</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters.

Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
