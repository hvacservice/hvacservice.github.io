<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
