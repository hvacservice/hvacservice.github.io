<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
