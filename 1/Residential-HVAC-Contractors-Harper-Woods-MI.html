<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a terrible, harsh summer.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your home lies, the local region's climate can alter significantly.
