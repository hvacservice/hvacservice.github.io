<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Jewett City CT - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
