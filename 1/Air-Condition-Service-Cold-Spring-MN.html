<p>Due to the fact that Perera funds his acquisitions from the company's money flow rather than working with a PE firm, Air Pros is a little bit different. He stated the selling firms have actually come from a range of sources, consisting of business brokers, financial organizers, and owners who found out about him through word of mouth.
