<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, specifically if you make it part of a build or remodelling job. For example, Warmup's StickyMat option can be set up as a Do It Yourself task as it is easy to put down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, prepared to be presented in location.
