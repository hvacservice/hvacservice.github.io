<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
<h3>Passive Ventilation in Danville Indiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
