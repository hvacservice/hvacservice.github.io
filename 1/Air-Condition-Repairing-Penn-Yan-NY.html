<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
