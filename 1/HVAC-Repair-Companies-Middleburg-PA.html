<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most affordable if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
