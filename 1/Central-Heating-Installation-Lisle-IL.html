<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
