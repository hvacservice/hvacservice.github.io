<p>Just like most house enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heating system can differ commonly based on the size of the home. Many furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years.

A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
