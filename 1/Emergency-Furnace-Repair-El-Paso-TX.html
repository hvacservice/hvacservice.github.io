<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
