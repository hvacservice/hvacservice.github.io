<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
