<p>For example, pollutants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption lies near a source of moisture or other outside contaminant, it might function as a pathway to bring the impurities inside.

Keeping what is most likely the most essential and expensive system in your home (heating and cooling) correctly maintained will assist keep your most significant investment of your life in good shape.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heater. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>Gas heaters do feature some downsides. The biggest downside is also the outcome of the combustion process. This process produces exhaust gases, including carbon monoxide gas, which need to be vented to the outside of the home. Carbon monoxide gas is an odor-free gas, and is highly poisonous in higher concentrations. A malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting issue might put your house's occupants in genuine risk because of this. It is very important to have your gas furnace frequently serviced, and to make sure your house has a carbon monoxide alarm installed.<p>
