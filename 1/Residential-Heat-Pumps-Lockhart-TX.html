<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
