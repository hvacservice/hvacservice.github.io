<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
