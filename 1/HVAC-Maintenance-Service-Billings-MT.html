A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
