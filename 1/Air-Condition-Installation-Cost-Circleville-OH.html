<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
