<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
