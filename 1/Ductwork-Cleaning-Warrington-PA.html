<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space a/c offers maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
