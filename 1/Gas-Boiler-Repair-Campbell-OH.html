<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

Not just will blocked vents and signs up affect your comfort, they can also lead to duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
