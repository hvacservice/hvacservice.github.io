<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
