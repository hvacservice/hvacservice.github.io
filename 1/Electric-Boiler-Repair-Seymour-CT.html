<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
