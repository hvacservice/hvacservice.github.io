<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
