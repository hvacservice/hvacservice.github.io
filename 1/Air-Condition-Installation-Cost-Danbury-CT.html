<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time.

Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
