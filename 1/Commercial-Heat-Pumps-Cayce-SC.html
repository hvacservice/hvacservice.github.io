<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
