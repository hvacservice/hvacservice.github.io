<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
