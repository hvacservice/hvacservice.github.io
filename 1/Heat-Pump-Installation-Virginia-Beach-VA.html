<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
