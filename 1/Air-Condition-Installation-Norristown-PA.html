Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
