Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
