<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>First, understand that a majority of your central air conditioning and system cost will originate from the system itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can really exceed $10,000 for bigger houses. As you saw recently, you need an appropriately-sized unit for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down faster than anticipated or your regular monthly energy expenses will increase. For that reason, you don't have overall control as to your AC unit material expenses.<p>
