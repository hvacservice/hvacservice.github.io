<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
