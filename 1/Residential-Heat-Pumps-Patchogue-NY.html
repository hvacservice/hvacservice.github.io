As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
