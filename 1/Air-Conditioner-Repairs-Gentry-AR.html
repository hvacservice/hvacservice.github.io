Depending on the kind of system installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust. Additionally, certain fuels and devices may need special permits, and there is minimal flexibility in case of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
