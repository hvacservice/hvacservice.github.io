In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

Because a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
