Some structures can also make use of natural ventilation by opening doors or windows.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for numerous damaging impacts, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce specific health issue. Individuals also react really in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants.
