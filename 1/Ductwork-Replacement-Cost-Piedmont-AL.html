So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON.

<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Piedmont AL 36272</h3>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
