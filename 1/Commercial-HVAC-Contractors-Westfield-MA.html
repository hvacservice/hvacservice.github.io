<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Westfield</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
