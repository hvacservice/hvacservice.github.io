<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
