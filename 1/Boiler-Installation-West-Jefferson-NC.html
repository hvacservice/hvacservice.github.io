Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated.

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in West Jefferson NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous individuals.<p>
