<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems.

<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a home with many windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
