Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week!

Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat.

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. A basic air conditioner transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
