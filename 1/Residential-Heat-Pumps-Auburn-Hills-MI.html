<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great idea to consider energy effectiveness. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance score as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run.

<p>The primary health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
