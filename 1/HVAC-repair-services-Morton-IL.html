<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.
