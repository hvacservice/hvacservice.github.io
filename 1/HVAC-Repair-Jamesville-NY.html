<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be efficiently identified or corrected without a detailed building investigation. These examinations may start with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building private investigators assess the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In some cases, these inquiries may rapidly discover the issue and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
