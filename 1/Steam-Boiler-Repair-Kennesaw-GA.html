<p>We look at ideas before we offer suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
