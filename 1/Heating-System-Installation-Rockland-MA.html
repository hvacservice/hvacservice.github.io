<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are accountable for many hazardous results, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are needed to produce particular illness.
