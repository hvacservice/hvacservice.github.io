<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
