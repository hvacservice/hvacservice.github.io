During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
