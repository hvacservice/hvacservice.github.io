<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c will not be able to cool your house appropriately. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each option can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, and describes the environment control systems installed in houses or commercial residential or commercial properties. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the building, to keep residents of the structure comfy. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system set up.<p>
