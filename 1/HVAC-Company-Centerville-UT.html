They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic.

He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable.
