<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
