<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has conducted. Investigations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the same to be true. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
