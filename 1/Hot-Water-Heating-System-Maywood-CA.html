<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be polluted (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread these toxins throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread toxins from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help minimize these problems.<p>
