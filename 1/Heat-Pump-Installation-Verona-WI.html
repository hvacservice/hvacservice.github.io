<p>Along with these weather condition changes, we've also been the nation's fastest growing city over the last decade, adding well over 100,000 people, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In most locations of our nation, a/c is a standard requirement, implying the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have cooling. Also, housing rates in Seattle have actually escalated, and as an outcome, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels. Lots of attics are also being transformed to complete bed rooms to add extra area. Rooms in the upper areas of homes are especially prone to getting uneasy and very hot throughout the summertime, making air conditioning much more necessary.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
