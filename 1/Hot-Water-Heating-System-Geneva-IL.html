Possibly it is time to start thinking about buying a new one if your furnace is in a very bad condition.<p>

<p>Factors that can contribute to the growth of biological impurities are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs.

Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and home plants.<p>
<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of reducing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will minimize but not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they construct up due to the fact that cigarette smoking produces such large quantities of toxins. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to significantly minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs substantially. Subsequently, the most reliable way to lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate cigarette smoking there.<p>
