<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
