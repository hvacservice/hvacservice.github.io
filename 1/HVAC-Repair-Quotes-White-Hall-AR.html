<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>It's not advised for uncertified people to repair & inspect air conditioning & HVAC equipment. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to an experienced ac repair Houston Midtown tech for appropriate HVAC medical diagnosis, it would be best. Constantly make sure when examining your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch. Be extremely careful when examining capacitors, even with the a/c system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power turned off.

<p>For pollutants besides radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or indications of poor ventilation and particular sources or contaminants have been identified as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems. Testing for lots of toxins can be expensive.

<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the general indoor air quality satisfies a particular standard. Occupational exposure limitations listed in health and safety regulations and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to prevent health problem or particular effects (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial scenarios. These limitations may not be suitable in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
