This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
