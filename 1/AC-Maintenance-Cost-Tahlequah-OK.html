<h3>HVAC Technician in Tahlequah Oklahoma</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some health impacts might show up shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are normally short-term and treatable.
