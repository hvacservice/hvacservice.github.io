<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
