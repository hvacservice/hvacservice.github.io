<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
