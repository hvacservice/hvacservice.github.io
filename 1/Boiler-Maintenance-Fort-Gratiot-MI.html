<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
