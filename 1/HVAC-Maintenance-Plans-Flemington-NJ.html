<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
