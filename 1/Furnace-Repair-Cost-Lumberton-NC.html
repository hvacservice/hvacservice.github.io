<h3>AC Technician in Lumberton NC 28358</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
