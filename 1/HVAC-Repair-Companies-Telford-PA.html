We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the ac system before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
