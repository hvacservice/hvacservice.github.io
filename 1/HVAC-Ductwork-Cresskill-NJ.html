<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if required, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
