<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the a/c to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the home. The technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or extreme dirt if the private parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
