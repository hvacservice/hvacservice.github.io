<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better option.
