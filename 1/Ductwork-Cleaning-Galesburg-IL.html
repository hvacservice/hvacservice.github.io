<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
