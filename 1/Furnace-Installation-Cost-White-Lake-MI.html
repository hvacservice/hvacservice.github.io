<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
