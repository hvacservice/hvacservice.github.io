<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
