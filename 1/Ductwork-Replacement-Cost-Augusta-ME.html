<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Augusta ME</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
