The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty.

<h3>Advantages of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Lodi CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
