<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater salaries for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competition for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average earnings for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify odors in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can often be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
