Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
