<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
