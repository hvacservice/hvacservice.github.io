<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Wayne MI</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
