<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope.
