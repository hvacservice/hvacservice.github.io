<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly.

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair.
