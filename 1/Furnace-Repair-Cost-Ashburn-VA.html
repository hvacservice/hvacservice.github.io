These undetectable electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a consisted of system like a home, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
