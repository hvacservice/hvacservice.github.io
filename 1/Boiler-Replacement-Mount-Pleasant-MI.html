<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
