For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If you're searching for a truthful, hard-working, very trustworthy, & educated air conditioning & heating contractor - offer Around the Clock a call! When I moved in 5+ years back, I was initially referred to Ilan & his team by several of my next-door neighbors. I have them perform an annual tune-up & the a number of times I require a service call, Ilan was able constantly able to fit me in the exact same day. They're fantastic with the interactions - phone, text, e-mail! I place allot of worth on a small company owner who lives in the neighborhood he services.<p>
