<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Utilize professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated experts perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

To have your radiator needs handled by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
