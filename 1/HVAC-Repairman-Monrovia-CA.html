<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
