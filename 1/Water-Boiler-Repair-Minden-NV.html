<p>Location the solar storage tank near the traditional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible.

Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Some health results might show up soon after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some illness such as asthma may appear, be exacerbated or aggravated.<p>
<p>Lots of disconnect blocks contain two cartridge merges. Examine them prior to you continue with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing system.
