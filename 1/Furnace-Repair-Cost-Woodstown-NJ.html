He clearly and completely explained all issues and repairs in a way that made me positive in his capability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not have to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory.
