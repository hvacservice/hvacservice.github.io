<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for residential and commercial HVAC organisations. HVAC service technicians are subject to a number of potentially hazardous conditions. Professionals are typically needed to work in cramped locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of homes.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. If your house is not heating up, just be worried. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to hire an expert to repair the system and check.<p>

<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.
