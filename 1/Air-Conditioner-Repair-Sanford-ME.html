Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Review of this information might recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
