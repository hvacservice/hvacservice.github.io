Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and extremely efficient, specifically throughout the Summer while the system acts to cool one's home. Because the excess heat soaked up from within the home is conducted into the hot water tank rather than being transmitted back into the earth, this is. The result, for that reason, is free warm water! Moreover, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water together with its primary purpose of providing space heating. This indicates that cost savings are still realized during the cooler period. In fact, a desuperheater reduces winter season water heating costs by roughly 50 percent.<p>
