And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
