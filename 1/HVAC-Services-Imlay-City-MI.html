<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health problems brought on by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
