The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
