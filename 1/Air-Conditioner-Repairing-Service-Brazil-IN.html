<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
