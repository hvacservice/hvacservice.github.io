<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
