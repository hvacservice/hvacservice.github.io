<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
