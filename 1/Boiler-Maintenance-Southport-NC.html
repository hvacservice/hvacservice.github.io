<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
