<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
