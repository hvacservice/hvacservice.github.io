<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Additionally, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, signs up and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heater can decrease the quantity of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
