<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
