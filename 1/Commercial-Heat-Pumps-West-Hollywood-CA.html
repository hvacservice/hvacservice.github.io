<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
