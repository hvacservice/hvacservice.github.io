<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
