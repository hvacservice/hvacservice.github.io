Start by opening the heat registers and after that carry on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover.

The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
