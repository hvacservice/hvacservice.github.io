<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
