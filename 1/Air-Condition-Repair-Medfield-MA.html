<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts decades, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
