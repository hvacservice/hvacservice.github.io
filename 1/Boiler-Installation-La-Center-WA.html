<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
