<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I've never seen before while being a homeowner for ten years. I also advise one of the Defense Plans, which I belong to, if you like to save cash.
