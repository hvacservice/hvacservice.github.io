<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage.

And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a build or remodelling task.

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
