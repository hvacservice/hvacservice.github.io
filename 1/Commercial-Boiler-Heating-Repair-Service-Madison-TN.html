<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
