<p>Enhance your services, make more services income, and supply a fantastic client experience. To make sure the unit you select is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load computation quote to identify the exact kind of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more information based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
