<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
