<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Middleburg FL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
