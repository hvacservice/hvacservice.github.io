Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
