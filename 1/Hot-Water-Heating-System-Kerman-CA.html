<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
