<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your duct inspected by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician discovers that your air ducts have significant mold, dust, dirt, and other pollutants or a moldy smell, they may suggest duct cleaning This is especially important if someone in your household has asthma, allergic reactions, or other signs that might be related to indoor air pollution.<p>

<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Evaluation Method (TEAM) research studies found levels of about a dozen typical natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or extremely industrial areas. Additional TEAM research studies indicate that while individuals are utilizing products containing natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
