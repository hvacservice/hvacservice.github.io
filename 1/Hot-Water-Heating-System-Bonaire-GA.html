<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

Residents, especially children and pregnant ladies, should leave the structure until all work is completed and clean-up is done.<p>
