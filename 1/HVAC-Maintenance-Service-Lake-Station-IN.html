<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
