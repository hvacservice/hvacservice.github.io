<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
