<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and assists tire them from the home.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
