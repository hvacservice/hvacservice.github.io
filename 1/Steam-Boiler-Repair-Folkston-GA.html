<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives generally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new construction (homes normally utilize between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
