<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate situation & chose to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were extremely professional, polite and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be successfully identified or treated without a detailed structure examination. These investigations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which structure detectives evaluate the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these inquiries might rapidly discover the issue and on-site gos to are unneeded.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
