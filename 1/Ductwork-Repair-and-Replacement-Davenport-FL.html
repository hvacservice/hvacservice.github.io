The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Improving those elements might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>
