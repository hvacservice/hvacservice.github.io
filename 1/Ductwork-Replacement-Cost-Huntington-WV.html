I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.
