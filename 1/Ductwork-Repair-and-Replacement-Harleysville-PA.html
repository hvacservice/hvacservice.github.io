<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
