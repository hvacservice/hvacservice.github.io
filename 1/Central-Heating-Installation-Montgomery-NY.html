<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo looks for more than just additional profits or scale when it makes acquisitions - it tries to find companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or supply a new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed minimal pipes work for select customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo expanded its abilities, enabling a boosted value proposition for a wider set of customers.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
