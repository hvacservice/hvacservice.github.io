<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

However, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
