<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really handy in collecting info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
