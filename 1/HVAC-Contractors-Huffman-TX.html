<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that collects during summertimes. The best thing to do is making sure that the heating unit burners are checked and cleaned completely prior to cooler seasons start. Always make certain that the furnace is cleaned up yearly to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working properly. Perhaps it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one if your furnace is in a very poor condition.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
