The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation in Perry Iowa</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
<p>As with homes, the most important factor influencing indoor air quality is the existence of contaminant sources. Commonly discovered office contaminants and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building supplies; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from constructing materials, carpet, and other office home furnishings, cleaning products and activities, restroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copier, and photography and printing shop; biological impurities from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can remain and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up until many years after direct exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from job sites.<p>
