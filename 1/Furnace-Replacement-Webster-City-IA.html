The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
