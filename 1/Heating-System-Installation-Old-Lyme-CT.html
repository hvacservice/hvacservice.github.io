<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Old Lyme CT</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a range of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, queasiness, confusion, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in individuals with chronic heart problem. The signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, senior people, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
