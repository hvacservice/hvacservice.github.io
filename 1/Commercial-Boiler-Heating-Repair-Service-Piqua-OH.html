<h3>Locating Best HVAC Contractors in Piqua OH</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. If the individual parts are in correct order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
