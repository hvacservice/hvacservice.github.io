<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
