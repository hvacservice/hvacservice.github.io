<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
