A building walk-through to check for smells and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be handy. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungis or bacteria and require to be removed, also.
