<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the flooring.

Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
