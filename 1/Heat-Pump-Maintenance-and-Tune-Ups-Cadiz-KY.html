<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
