<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in East Islip NY</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And A/c is HVAC Contractor offering the very best possible Heating and Air Conditioning Repair, maintenance and installation for your home or business in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Island of Palms South Carolina.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
