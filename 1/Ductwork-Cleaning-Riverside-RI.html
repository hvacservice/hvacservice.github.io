Depending on the kind of unit installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust.

Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Through regular usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit might become very unclean.

The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for appropriate function and total condition.
