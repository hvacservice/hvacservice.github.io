<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room.
