<p>Some health impacts can be useful indications of an indoor air quality problem, specifically if they appear after an individual transfers to a brand-new residence, remodels or refurnishes a house, or deals with a house with pesticides. If you think that you have signs that might be related to your house environment, discuss them with your physician or your local health department to see if they could be brought on by indoor air contamination. You might also want to seek advice from a board-certified allergist or an occupational medication specialist for responses to your concerns.<p>
