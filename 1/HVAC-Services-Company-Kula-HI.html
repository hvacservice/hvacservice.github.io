<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
