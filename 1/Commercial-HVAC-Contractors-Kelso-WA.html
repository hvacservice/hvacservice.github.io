<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
