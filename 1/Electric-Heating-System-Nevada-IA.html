<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions.
