They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
