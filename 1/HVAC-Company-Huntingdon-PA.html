<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and uncomplicated approach to reduce ambient air pollution and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
