<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
