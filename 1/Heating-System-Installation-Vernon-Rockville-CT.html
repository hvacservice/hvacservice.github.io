<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
