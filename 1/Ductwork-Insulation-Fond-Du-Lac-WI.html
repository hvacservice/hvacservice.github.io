<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
