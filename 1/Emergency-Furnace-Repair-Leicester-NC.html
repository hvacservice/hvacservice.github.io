Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
