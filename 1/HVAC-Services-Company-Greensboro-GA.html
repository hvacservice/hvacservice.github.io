<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
