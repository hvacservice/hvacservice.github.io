<h3>Electric Furnace in Englewood Colorado</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these significant however small modifications in his bid. Because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
