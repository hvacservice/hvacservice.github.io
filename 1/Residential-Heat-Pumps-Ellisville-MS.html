<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Ellisville MS 39437</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners need to look out to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps must not be undertaken until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
