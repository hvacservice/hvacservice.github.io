<p>These men have been terrific. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these people two times. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
