<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
