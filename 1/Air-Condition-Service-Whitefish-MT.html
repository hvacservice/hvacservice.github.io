<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level.
