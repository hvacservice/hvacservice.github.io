<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and very large homes.

A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
