<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Cheraw South Carolina</h3>
<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, wood, tobacco, and coal products; structure materials and home furnishings as diverse as scrubby, asbestos-containing insulation, moist or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furnishings made from particular pushed wood products; products for household cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air contamination.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as a car radiator or typical household ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
