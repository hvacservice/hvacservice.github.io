<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the ac system is large, it might not attain a low humidity.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
