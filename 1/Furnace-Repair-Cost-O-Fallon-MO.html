<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity.
