<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
