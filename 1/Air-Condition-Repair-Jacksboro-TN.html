<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being blocked, reducing air flow volume, quality, and circulation.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
