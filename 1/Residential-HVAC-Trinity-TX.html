<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
