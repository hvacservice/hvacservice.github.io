<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
