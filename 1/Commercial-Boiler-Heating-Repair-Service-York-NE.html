<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to choose products that will prevent indoor air issues from taking place - a number of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about using solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source away from occupants or perhaps moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease contaminants, we suggest setting up innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to remove the smallest particles from the air.
