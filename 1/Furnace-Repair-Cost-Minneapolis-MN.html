<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly.

While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outside air.
