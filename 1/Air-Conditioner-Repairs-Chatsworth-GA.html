If you have access to low-cost or complimentary firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it might not cost you anything. Unfortunately, wood-burning heating systems require a very important natural deposit: wood! Wood-burning heat systems may not be excellent for the environment regardless of being carbon neutral due to the fact that of the quantity of wood needed to properly heat your whole house.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
