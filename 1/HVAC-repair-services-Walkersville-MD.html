<p>The types of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the different houses they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, homes, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.).

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
