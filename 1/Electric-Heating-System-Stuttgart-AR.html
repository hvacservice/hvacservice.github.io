They include hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, children, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead.

<h3>Steam Boiler Repair in Stuttgart AR 72160</h3>

Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
