<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
