<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
