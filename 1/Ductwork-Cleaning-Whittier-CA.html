This would be an instance where you must call in a professional to repair the unit and check.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
