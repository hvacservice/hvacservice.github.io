<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
