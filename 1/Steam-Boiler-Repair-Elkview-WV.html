<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
