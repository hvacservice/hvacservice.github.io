<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, work environments and schools matters, particularly since we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other perks. Some companies use priority visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>
