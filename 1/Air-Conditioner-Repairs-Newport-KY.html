<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Newport Kentucky</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Newport KY</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations.
