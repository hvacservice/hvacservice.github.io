<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
