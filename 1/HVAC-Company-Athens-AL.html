<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
