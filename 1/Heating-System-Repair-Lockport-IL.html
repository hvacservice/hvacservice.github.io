<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install.

<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
