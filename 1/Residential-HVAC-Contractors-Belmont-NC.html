Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
