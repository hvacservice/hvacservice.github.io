<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
