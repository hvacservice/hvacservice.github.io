<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
