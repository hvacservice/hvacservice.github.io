<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Sheppard Afb TX</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
