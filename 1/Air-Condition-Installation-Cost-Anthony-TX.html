Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
