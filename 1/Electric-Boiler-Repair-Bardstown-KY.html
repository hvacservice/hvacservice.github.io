<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating & cooling system uses substantially less electrical energy compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
