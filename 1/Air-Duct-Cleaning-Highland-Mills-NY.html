<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Highland Mills NY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
