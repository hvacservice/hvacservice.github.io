<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality problem is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated problems-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack.
