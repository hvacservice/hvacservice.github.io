<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
