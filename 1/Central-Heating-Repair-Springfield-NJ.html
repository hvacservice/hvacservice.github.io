The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
