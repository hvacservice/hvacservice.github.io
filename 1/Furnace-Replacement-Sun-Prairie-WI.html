<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed extremely quickly.
