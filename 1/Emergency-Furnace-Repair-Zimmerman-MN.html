<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") explains how within air can affect an individual's capability, convenience, and health to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, absence of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does provide guidelines about the most common IAQ workplace complaints.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
