Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
