<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
