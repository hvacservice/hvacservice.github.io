<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
