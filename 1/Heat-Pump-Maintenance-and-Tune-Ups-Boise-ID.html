<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
