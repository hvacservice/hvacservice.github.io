<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
