<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
