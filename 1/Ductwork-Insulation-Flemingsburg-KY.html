<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
