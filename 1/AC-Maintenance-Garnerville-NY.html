<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
