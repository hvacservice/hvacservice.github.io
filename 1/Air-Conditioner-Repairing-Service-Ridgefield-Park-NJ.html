<p>Structures are created or intended to react actively to a few of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to enhance their look, efficiency, or durability. In other cases, such modifications subtly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that might be necessary to their own integrity or their impact on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, some of the methods used by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Immediate results might appear after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear not long after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
