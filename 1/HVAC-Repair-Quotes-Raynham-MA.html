<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
