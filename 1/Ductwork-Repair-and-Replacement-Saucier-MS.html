<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the maker's directions.<p>
