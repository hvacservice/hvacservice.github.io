<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
