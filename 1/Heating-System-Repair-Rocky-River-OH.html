<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Many commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air introduced into an area per a system of time, and is often revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, heating and air-conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter season can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are accountable for lots of harmful results, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce particular illness. People also react really in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. Further research is needed to better understand which health results happen after exposure to the average toxin concentrations discovered in houses and which take place from the greater concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
