<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in San Jacinto CA 92583</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
