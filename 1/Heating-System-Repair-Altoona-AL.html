<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
