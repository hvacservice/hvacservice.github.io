They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My partner said that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have met in a long time.
