No matter what the type of home HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is operating securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such aspects include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
