<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects during summers.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>

There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
