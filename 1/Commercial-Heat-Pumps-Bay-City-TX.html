<p>We take a look at clues before we provide suggestions to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
