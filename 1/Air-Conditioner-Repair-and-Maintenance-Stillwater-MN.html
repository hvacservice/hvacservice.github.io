<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer.

<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Stillwater MN</h3>
<p>The majority of people are aware that outdoor air contamination can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can likewise have substantial, hazardous impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading five environmental health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
