<p>Picking the right size air conditioning unit is a vital part of the HVAC purchasing process and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to assist you with.

And if it's too little, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the quantity (and often quality) of outdoor air that ought to be constantly supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
