There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. Overall, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then realized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by just utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a service or merchant to do the installation.
