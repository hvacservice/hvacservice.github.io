<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Harrisonburg VA 22801</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Many furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnÃ¢ $ t effectively detected, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. ItÃ¢ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
