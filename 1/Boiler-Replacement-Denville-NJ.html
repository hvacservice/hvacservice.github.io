<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
