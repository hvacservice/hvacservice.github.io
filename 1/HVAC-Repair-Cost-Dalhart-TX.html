<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12.
