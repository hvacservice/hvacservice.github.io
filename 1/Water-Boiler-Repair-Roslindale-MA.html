<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long haul. Rates for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heaters start at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service. If the present system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Only an expert can properly detect why your furnace isn't beginning.

Similarly, if the procedure does not work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it often, it's most likely time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
