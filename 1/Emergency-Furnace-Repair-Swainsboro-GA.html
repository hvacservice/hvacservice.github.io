<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
