<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
