<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
