<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
