<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Northridge CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
