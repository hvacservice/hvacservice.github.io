They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My wife stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have satisfied in a long period of time.
