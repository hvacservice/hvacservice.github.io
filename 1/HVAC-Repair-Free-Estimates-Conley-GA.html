<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are offered to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Environment Pro is reliable and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that same night.

Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week!

<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Service in Conley Georgia</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
