Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
