<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioner won't have the ability to cool your house effectively. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
