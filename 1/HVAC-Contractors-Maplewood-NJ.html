<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Installation fees differ across the county, but start at approximately $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes around 5 hours to set up a little furnace and more to set up a large one.<p>
