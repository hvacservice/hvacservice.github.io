<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
