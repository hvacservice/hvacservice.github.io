<p>Many people do not realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and ultimately damage it enough that you need to invest in furnace replacement or AC replacement.

Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
