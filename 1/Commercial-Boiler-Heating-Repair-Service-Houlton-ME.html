<h3>AC Maintenance in Houlton ME 04730</h3>
<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources might not present a significant health threat by themselves, a lot of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician examine the system regularly.<p>
