<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
