<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
