(He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
