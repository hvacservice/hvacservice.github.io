<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
