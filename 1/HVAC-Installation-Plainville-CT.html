<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered great customer care at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>

Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, cruel summer season.<p>
