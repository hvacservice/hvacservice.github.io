<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
