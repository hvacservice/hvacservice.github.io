<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
