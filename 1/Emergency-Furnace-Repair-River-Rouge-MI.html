<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices doubts because they only partly remove the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the home. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy ways of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or skills needed to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
