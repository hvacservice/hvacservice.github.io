<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
