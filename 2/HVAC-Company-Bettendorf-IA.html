<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Bettendorf IA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
