<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house is located, the local area's environment can change significantly. A home located in the South would need an AC system with a size efficient in cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would need a much bigger heating capacity too which will impact costs. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement costs by LOADS.<p>
