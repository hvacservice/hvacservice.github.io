Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a brand-new structure. Required air systems will need a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heat pumps.
