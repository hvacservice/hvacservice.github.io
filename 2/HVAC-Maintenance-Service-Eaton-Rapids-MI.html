<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.
