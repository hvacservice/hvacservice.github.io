<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
