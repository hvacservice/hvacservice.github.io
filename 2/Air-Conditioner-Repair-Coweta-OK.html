<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

His time and know-how to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>If your air conditioner is more than 8 years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's a basic problem like particles clogging the condenser unit or a used fan belt.
