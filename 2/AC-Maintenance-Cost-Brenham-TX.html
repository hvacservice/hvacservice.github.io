<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
