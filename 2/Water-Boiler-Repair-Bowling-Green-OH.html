<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Bowling Green OH</h3>

Likewise, because systems have to be replaced after about a decade, many buildings will end up being due for replacement units in the next couple of years. Due to these reasons, the task development for this occupation is higher than average.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
