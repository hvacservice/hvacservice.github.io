With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
