<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
