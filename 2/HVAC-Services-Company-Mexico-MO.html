<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke with from beginning to end were really professional, polite and the work was really efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, however cause other health problems.

VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
