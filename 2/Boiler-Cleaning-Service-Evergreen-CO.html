The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
