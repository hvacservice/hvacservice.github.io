Whether you need an inspection, repair, installation or maintenance for your HVAC system, you can count on the experts at AAA Heating & Cooling to do the job right.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but lots of use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service. If the present system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
