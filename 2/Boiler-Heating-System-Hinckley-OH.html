For this factor, it is important to take notice of the time and place symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is away from the area, for instance, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Buildings are developed or planned to react actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to boost their longevity, performance, or look. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps considerably change structures in manner ins which might be very important to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We might find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
