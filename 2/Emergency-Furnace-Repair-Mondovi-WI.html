<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Mondovi WI</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

We'll visit your house for a comprehensive inspection, consisting of an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to discover the best system for your home.
