<p>Indoor air contamination is brought on by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can differ significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance task may need absolutely different actions and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined.

In many cases, completely brand-new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>

When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations develop indoors, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
