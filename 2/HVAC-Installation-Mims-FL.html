The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
