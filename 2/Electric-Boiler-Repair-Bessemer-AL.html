<p>The purpose of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load computing is described as the Handbook J estimation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling.

Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
