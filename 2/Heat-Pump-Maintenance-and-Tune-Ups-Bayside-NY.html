Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
