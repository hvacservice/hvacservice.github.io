<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
