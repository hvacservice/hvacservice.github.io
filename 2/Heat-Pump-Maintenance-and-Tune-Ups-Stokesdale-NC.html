<p>These guys have actually been terrific. At a realtor, I often require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
