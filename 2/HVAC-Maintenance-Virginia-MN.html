<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Virginia MN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
