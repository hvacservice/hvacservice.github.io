<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competition for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical earnings for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>The predominant health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
