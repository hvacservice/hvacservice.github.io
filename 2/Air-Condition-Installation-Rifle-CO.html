For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the time and location signs happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is away from the location, for instance, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent indoors.<p>
