Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
