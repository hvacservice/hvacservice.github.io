<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings exhale co2, which in little quantities is not toxic, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Micro-organisms or germs might also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the whole office or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
