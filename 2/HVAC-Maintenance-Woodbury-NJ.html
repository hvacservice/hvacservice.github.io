<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really useful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>

Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
