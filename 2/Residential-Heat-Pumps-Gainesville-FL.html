<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate considerable savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more information based on how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
