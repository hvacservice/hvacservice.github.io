<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
