<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Harrison AR</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in locations throughout the summer season? Whether you're having a problem with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Convenience, Inc. has the services and products you need.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
