<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in New Fairfield CT</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
