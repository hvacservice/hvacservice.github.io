<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
