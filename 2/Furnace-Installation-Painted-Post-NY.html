<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Painted Post NY</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
