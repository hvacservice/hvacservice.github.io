<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Temple PA?</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outdoor air contamination can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can also have considerable, harmful result. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of contaminants might be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
