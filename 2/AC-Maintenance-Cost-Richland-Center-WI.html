<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years.
