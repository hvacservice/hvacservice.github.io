If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area.
