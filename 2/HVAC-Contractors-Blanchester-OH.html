<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their efficiency with time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
