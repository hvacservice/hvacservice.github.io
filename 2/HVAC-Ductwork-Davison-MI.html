<p>If it's time to update an aging AC, variable speed is the method to go. Already planning to replace an existing a/c unit? Assuming your budget accommodates a variable speed unit, you need to definitely get one! You'll feel more comfortable throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner.

<p>Oil heating systems are usually not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but a lot of do not attain a performance greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also because a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>If your single stage air conditioning system isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for higher convenience at higher temperature levels.<p>
