<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
