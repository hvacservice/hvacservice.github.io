I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
