However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The main danger of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the capability of mold to trigger episodes personallies that already have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner.

We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
