<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust.

Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
