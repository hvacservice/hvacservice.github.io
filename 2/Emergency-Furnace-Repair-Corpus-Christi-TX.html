<p>Lots of commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air introduced into a space per a system of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window.
