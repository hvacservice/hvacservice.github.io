<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. There are a number of design approaches in usage today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable principles.

These various heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources.
