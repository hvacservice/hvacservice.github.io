<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal company. A thoroughly crafted company plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to handle those peaks and lulls so your revenues remain healthy year-round. If you didn't create a heating and cooling service strategy when you began your company, it's not too late to construct one now, or to offer your original strategy an update.<p>
<p>A/c unit makers normally make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioning unit fails, start by checking any merges or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
