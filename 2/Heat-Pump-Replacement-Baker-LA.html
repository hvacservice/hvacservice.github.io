<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at home over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants or perhaps relocating prone occupants.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a few years back.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
