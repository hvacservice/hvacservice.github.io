<h3>Gas Central Heating in Lovington NM 88260</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
