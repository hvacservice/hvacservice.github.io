<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
