<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
