<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
