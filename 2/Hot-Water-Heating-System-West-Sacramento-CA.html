<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
