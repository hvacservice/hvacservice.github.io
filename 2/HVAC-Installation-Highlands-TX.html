<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of homes.
