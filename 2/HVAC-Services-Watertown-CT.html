<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
