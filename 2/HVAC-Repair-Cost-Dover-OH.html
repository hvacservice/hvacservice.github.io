<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
