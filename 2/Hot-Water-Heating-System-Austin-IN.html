<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Austin</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean considerable savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
