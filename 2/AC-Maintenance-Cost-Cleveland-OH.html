Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
