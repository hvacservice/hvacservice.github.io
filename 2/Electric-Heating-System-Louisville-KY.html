<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
