<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
