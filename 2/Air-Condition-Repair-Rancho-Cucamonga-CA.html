When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room.

To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.
