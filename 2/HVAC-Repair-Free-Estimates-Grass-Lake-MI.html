<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
