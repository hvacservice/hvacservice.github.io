If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
