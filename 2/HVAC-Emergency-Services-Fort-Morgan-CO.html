<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.

If  it doesn't, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
