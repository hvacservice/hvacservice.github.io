<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
