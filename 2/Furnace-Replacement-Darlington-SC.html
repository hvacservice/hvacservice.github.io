<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
