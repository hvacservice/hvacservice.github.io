<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Inver Grove Heights MN</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
