<p>The heatpump got popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature operation and minimized loads due to more effective houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Similar to most house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating system can vary widely based on the size of the home. Most heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
