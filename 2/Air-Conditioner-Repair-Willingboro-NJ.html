<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
