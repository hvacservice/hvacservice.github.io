<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Bradley IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they ought to be placed.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
