<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
