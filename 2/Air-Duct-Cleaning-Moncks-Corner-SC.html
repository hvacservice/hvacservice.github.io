<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
