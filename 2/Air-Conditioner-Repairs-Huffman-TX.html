<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main issue in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has conducted. Investigations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is essential in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being blocked, lowering air flow quality, volume, and distribution.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
