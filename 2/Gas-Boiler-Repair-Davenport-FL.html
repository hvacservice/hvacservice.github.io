<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heater can also be connected to a device known as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This implies that this device can also provide complimentary hot water for domestic use in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
