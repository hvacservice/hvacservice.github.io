<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Oxford PA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in home building and construction is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>With today's sophisticated heating and cooling systems, it is necessary to work with a reputable HVAC contractor with legitimate credentials. Combs Heating & Cooling is totally accredited and insured. All of our competent contractors have up-to-date HVAC licenses and remain in compliance with local and state laws.
