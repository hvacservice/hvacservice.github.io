<p>Central air units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
