The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level.
