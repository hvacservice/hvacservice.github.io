<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
