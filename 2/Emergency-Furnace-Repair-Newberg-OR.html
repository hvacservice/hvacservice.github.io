<p>Heating systems resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part just require another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below zero night.<p>
<p>Similar to homes, the most important factor influencing indoor air quality is the presence of contaminant sources.
