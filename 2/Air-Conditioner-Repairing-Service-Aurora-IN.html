<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal parts also. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, but are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this might spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
