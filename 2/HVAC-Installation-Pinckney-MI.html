There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
