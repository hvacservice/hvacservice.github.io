<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<h3>Strategies for Quick Furnace Repair in Sunset LA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioner prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
