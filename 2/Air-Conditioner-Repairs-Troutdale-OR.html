<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
