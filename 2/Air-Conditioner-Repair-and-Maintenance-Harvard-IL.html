<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
