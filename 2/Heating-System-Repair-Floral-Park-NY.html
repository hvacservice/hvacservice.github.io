<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
