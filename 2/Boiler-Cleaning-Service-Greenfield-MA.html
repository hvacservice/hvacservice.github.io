<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
