<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the assessment on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health danger factor and contractor laws for their decision.
