<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
