Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
