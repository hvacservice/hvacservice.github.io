<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.)

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
