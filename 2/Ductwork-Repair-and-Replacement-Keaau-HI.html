<h3>AC Unit Repair in Keaau Hawaii</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Think about buying an energy-efficient design if your air conditioner is old. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems are about 15% more effective than basic models. New residential central air conditioner requirements went into impact on January 1, 2015; see the performance standards for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and think about buying a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher cost savings.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
