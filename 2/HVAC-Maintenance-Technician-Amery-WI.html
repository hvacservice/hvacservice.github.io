<p>Buildings are designed or planned to respond actively to some of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and maintain surface areas to enhance their appearance, performance, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps significantly change buildings in manner ins which may be necessary to their own stability or their influence on structure occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might discover it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, some of the approaches used by researchers studying environments, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
