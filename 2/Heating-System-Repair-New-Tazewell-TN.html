<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in New Tazewell TN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
