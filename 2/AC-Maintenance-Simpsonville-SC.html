<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
