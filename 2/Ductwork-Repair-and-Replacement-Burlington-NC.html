<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
