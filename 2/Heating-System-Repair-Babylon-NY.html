Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your residential or commercial property and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage during the winter season. The majority of the time, this simply consists of some buildup of dirt and particles, which is quite simple to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or extreme wear to the outside. They may suggest that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to guarantee appropriate air flow around the system.<p>

However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must call in an expert to check and repair the unit.<p>
