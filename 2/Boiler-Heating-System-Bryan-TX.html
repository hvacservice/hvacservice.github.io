The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
