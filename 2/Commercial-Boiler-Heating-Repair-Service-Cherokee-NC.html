<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
