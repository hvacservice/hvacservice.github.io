<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold notifies. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality.

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
