<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
