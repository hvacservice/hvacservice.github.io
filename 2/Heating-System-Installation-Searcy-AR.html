<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
