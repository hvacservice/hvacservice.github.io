These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result.
