<p>I am an investor, I require to change 2 furnaces in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch toxins more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities like smoking cigarettes, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies launch contaminants intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or improperly used items can launch greater and sometimes unsafe levels of toxins inside your home.<p>

An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
