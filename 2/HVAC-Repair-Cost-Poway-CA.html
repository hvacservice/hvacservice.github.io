Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
