Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.
