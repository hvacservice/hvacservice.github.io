<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Clayton CA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
