<p>Streamline your services, earn more services income, and provide a remarkable client experience. To make sure the system you choose is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to identify the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't just replace it with the very same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON.
