<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
