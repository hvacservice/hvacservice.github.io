They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead.
