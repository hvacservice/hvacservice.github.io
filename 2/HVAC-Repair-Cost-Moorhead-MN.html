<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent.
