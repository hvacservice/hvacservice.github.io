<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
