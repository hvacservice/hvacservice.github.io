Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
