Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON.
