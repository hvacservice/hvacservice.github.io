<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
