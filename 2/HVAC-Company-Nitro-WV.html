<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

The average summer temperature level to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the appropriate SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83.
