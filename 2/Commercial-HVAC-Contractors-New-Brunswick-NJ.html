<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>You could update to the greatest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance in New Brunswick NJ 08901</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were really professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic customer support at the end of the visit by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered remarkable, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction style is friendly, efficient and appealing. He clearly and completely explained all issues and fixes in a manner that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my wife and I would not need to endure another night without heat, throughout among the coldest winters in recent memory. He likewise reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the first see due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>Consider possible results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
