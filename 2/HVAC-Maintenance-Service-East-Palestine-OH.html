<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
