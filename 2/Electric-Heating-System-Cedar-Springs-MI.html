Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the biggest energy consumers in your home, so property owners who might be looking for a new furnace must thinking about replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient design to save cash and help the environment.

Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
