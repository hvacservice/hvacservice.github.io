<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters obstructed with dust, family pet hair and other particles cause problems like failure to offer sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.
