<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
