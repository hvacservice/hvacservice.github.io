On those days when you just can't seem to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not prone to this issue because they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Furthermore, given that they do not trust fans, ducts, signs up and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can reduce the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
