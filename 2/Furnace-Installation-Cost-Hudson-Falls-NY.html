<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded. Often there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
