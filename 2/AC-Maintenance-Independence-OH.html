<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling.

<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of houses in cooler climates were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors heated. In turn, the objects in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
