<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%.

Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
