<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
