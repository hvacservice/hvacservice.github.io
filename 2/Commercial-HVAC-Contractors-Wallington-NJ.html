<p>The purpose of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at sensible energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning.
