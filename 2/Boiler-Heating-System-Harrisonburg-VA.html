<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other kinds of heatpump, have actually efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a clinical way of determining just how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every single unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to five systems are provided as heat.<p>

However, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same).

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
