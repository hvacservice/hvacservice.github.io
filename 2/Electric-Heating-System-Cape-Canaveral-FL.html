<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature level all year round.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
