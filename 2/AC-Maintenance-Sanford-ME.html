We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
