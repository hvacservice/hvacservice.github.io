<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For New Milford NJ Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that things ran smoothly without any sound, I was very pleased in the beginning. Moreover, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical power costs. After 2 years, things began to alter. There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it fixed and examined. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then realized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
