<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Eastman GA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
