<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year.

Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
