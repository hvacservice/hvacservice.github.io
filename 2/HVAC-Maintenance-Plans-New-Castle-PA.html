<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
