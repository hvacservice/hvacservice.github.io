<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
