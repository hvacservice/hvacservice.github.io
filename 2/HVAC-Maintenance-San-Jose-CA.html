But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
