<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heater) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the rooms. The majority of modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
