<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
