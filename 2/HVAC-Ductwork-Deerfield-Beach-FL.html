<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Kids might have greater exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
