<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
