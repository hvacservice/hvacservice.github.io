<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher wages for air conditioning tradesmen.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
