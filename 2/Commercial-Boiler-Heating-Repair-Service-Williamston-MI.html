<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it significantly challenging for your lungs to operate properly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
