<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
