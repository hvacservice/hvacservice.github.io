<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to comprehend and keep.<p>
