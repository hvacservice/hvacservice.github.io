<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working.
