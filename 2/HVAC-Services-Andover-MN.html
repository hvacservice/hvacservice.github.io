<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Company in Andover</h2>

<p>Enhance your services, make more services profits, and offer an amazing customer experience. To make certain the system you choose is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we don't just change it with the same size unit you presently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
