Preventive measures include adjusting typical hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and regular testing in suspect locations.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.
