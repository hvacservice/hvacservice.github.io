<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level.

<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare events.<p>
