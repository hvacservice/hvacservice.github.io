<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
