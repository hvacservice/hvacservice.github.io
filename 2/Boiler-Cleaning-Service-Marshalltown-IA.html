<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a business or merchant to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the a/c system. A voided guarantee won't do you any excellent should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and hire a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
