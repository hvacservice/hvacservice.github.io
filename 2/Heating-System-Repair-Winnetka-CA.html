<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
