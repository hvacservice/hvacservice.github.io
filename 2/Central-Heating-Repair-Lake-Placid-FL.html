<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Lake Placid FL 33852</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

From there you can take the appropriate action to fix the situation instantly.<p>
