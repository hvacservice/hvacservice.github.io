<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in North Wales PA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
