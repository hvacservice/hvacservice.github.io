Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
