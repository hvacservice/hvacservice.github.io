There are a number of style methods in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heatpump run with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
