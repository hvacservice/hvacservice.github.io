<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels.
