<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Opelika AL 36801</h3>
<p>There are 2 primary types of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
