<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives inside. A/c assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person should be required nearly any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally inspected and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>
