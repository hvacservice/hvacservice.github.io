<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has actually not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense also.<p>

For example, people exhale co2, which in small quantities is not harmful, but might end up being harmful if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Germs or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
