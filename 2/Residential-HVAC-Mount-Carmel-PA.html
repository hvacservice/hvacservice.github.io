Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
