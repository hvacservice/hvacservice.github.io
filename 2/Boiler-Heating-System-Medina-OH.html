<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is because something is clogged or dirty Prior to attempting to repair any issue, require time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Check the furnace blower for blocking and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. Call an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
