<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types.

Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
