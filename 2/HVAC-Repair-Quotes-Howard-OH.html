<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new construction (homes normally use in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
