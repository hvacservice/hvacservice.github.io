<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
