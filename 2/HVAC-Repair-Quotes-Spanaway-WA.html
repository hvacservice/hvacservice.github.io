<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
