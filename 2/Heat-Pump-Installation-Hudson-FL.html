<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
