Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely humid climates or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
