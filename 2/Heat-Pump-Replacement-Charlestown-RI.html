<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system.

<h3>The Way to Get Rid of Boiler Issues in Charlestown RI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
