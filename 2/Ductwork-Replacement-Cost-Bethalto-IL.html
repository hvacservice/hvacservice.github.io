<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
