<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
