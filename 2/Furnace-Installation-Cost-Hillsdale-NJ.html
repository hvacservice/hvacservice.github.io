<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
