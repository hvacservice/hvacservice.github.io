If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
