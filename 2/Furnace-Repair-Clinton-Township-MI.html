<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
