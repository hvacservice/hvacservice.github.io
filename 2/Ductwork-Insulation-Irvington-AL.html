<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
