<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that resistance differs considerably from private to specific, it is not practical to design a universal standard fit for all in terms of exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a ten years study analyzing more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples examined were checked favorable for fungis and germs.<p>
