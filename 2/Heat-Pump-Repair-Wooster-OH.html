<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
