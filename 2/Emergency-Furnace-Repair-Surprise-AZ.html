In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company.
