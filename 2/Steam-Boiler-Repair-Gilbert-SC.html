<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Gilbert SC</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
