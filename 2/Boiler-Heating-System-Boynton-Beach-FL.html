In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Subsequently, the most effective way to lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
