<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, a lot of Seattleites need to discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a cruel, harsh summer.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system seems less like a luxury item and more like a need. (Besides, warmed floors were great enough for the Roman Empire) However before you devote to what can be a major renovation project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heater is an appropriate service for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
