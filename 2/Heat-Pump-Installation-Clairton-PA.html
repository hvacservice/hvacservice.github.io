<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

While an area heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
