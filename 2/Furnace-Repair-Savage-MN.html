<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is generally recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
