<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
