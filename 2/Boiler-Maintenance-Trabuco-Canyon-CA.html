<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
