Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
