<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
