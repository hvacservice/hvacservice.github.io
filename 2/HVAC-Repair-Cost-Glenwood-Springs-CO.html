<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
