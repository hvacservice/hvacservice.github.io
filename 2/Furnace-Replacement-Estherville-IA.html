<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
