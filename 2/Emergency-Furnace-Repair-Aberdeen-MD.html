<p>At Raleigh Heating & Air, we believe in offering our customers with high quality service at sensible and reasonable prices. You may be able to find what appears like a much better deal in other places, but before deciding, we motivate you to think about other elements, such as experience, licenses, NATE Certified professionals, membership holdings, and customer fulfillment prior to choosing a heating and cooling company. We believe our history of quality work and consumer fulfillment, coupled with our reasonable rates and extensive credentials, promotes itself. We look forward to speaking with you and providing you with all your house comfort needs. Call today with any concerns you have. We service Raleigh, Wake Forest, Cary, higher Wake County and the surrounding areas.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of numerous) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive option, however newer systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient natural gas heating systems can achieve AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our options did an outstanding job in making sure we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The service technicians who installed the brand-new system were professional and fast, while requiring time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
