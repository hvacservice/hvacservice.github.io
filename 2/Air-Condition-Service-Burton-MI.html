The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
