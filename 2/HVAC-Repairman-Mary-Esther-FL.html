<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
