<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's directions.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up because the soot develops inside the ducts, reducing their efficiency over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To find smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
