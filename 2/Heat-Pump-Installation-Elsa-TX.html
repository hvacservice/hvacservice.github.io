<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
