<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
