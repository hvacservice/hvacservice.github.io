<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
