I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
