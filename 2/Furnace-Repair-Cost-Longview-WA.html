<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
