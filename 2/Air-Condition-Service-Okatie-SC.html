From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
