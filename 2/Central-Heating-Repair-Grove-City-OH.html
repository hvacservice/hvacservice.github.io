We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms.
