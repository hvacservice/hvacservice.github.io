Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
