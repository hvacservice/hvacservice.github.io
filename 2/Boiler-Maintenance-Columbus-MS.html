<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
