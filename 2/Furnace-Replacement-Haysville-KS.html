<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
