<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
