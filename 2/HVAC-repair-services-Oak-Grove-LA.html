<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
