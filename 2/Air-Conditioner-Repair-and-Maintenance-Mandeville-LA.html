<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than lots of heatpump options, they can still be highly effective, depending on the design you buy.
