<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
