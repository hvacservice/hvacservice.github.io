After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

In turn, the things in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
