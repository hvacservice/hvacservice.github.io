<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Heflin Alabama</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
