<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
