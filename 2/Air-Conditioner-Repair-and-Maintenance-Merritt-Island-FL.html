<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
