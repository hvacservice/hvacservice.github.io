Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week!

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company should inspect measurements of humidity, temperature and air circulation. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for building use and tenancy) must be performed. A building walk-through to look for smells and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings might be valuable. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungis or germs and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>This handbook explains the WH-1. Active, direct systems. (See System Diagram). The Model Sun Ray WH-1. is an active, direct system.
