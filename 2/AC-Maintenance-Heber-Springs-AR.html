<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The most efficient fans are peaceful and durable. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
