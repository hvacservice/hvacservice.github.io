<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.
