<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>If you wish to save yourself money and time over the long term, having actually yearly maintenance performed on the furnace is an excellent concept.
