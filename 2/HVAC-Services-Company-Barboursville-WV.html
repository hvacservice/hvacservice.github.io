<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>
