Therefore, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
