<h3>Advantages of Investing on Gas Furnaces in Greenbrae CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
