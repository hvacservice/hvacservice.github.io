<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
