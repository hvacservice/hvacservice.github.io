Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my pals.<p>
