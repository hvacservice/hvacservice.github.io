<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
