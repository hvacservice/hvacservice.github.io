<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
