<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
