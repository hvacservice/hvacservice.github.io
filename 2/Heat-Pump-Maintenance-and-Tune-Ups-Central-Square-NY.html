<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
