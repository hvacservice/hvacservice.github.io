<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
