<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
