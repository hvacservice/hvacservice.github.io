<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Many AC units feature a variety of unique functions that can even more enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
