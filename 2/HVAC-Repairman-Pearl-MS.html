<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are less typical now than natural gas, but they can be useful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to gain access to, and in cooler environments because it supplies more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be greater, as much as 3 times higher than gas or electric heating systems. They require a storage tank on the immediate property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they provide an AFUE ranking of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
