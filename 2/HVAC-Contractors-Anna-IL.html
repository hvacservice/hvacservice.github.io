No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively affects residential or commercial property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Possibly Realtors need to think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may add to, or subtract from, any given asking rate.
