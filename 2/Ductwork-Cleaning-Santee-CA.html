<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
