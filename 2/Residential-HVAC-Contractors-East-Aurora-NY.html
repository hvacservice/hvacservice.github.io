<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>

All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
