The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
