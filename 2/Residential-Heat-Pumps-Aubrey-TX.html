<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
