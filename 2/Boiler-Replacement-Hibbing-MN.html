CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
