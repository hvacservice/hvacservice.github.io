<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
