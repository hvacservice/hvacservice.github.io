(And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.)

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
