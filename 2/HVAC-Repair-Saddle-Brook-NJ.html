<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
