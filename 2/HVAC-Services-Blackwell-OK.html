<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and many other products.<p>
