<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The essential part of your air conditioning is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling.

The majority of the time, this just consists of some buildup of dirt and debris, which is pretty easy to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated moisture, or excessive wear to the outside. They might recommend that you trim back thick trees or bushes to ensure adequate air flow around the system.<p>
