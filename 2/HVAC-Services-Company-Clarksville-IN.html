<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company in Clarksville IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
