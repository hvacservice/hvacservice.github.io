<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer.

This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
