<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
