If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions widespread in the house.<p>

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
