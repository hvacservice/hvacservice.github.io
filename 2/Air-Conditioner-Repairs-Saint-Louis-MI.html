<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
