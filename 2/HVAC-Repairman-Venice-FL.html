<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
