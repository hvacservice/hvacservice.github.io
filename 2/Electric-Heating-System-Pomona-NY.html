<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not warm up.

A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
