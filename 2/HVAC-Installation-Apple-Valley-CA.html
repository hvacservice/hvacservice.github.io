<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your home might not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To detect odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
