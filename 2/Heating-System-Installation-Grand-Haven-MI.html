<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for several years.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>In-floor heating unit can come with particular health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heater are not susceptible to this issue. Additionally, given that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and signs up to distribute hot air, in-floor heater can lower the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
