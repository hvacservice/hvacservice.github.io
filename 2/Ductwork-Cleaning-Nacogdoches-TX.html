<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
