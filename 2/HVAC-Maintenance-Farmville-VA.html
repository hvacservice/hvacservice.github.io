Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>

Next, examine other components of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, particles and dust, an economical fix that can help boost efficiency. Also, examine the vents and ducts for blockage.

Try moving it far from direct sunlight since this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature level in your home.
