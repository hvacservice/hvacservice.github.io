<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, coal, or oil. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth. Furthermore, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes significantly less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, providing a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) research studies discovered levels of about a lots common natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outside, no matter whether the houses were located in rural or extremely industrial locations. Extra GROUP studies suggest that while individuals are using items containing natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
