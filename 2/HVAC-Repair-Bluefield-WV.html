<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially expensive to set up, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of system installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust. Additionally, certain fuels and devices might require unique permits, and there is limited versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
