<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no proof, however, that an affordable variety of houseplants eliminate considerable quantities of pollutants in workplaces and houses. Because excessively moist soil may promote the development of microorganisms which can impact allergic people, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
