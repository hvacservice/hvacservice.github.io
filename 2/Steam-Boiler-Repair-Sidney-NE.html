<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and medical facilities, lorries such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, submarines and airplanes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with regard to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
