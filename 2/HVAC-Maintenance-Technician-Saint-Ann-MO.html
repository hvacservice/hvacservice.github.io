(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
