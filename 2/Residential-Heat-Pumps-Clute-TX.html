<h3>Furnace Installation in Clute TX 77531</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps should also be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents need to look out to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out until these problems have been remedied.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
