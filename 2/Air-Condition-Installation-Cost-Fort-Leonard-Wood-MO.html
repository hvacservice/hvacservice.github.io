They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
