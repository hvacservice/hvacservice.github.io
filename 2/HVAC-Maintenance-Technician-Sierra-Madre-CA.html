<p>For whole home installations, it's challenging, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, particularly a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or several spaces like restrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly remodelled with electric glowing flooring heat. This is much more cost-efficient on a smaller sized scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house may be suitable for a larger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>

<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to reduce pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals need to be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures should not be carried out until these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
