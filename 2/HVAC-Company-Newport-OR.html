<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
