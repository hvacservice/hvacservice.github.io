<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
