<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
