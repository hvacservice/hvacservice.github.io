<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends on private sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment and large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on routine sunlight to work effectively.

ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
