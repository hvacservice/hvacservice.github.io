<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo tries to find more than simply additional earnings or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can broaden Pueblo's customer base or supply a brand-new line of services. For instance, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed minimal plumbing work for select clients. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, enabling a boosted value proposition for a wider set of clients.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level.
