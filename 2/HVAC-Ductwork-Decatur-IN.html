<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in gathering info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.
