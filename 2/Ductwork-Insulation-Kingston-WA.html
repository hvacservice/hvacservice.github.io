<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the concern and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are generally smaller sized than stick-built residential or commercial properties and utilize significantly less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile home oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as many brand names produce oil heating systems for this usage, and you may discover more alternatives with natural gas, lp, or electric heating systems.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
