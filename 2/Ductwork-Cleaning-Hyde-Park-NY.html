<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
