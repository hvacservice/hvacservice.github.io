<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
