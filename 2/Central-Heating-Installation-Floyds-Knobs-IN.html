<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less regular (but often more severe) cases of people ending up being ill after being in a particular structure at a particular time. In these cases, there is typically a similar set of clinical symptoms experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI caused by bacteria which can pollute a building's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan does not. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins.
