<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next step is to thaw your cooling equipment. The easiest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit.

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
