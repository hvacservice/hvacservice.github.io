<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
