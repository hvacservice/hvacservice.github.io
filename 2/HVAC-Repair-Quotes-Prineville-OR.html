<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.
