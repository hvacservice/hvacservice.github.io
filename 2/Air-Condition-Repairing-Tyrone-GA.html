<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Tyrone GA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
