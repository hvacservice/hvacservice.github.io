<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
