<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level.

To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
