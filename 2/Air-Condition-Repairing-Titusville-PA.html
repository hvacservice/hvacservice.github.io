<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
