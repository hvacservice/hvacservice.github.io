<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>All heater have some level of air filtering. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
