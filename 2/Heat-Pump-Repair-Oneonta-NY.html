<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
