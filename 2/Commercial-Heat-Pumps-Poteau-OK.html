One of the primary areas where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
