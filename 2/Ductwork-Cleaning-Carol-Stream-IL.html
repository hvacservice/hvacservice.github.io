<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
