<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Bensenville IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally occur when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is poorly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
