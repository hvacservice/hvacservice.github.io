<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
