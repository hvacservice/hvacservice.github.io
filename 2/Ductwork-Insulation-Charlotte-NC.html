<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment.
