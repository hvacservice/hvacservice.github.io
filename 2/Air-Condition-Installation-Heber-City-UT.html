<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes checking the suggested connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and safe.<p>
