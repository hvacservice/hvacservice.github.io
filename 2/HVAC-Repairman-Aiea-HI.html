Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
