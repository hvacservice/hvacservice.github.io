<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Paramount CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>While many average homeowners can handle basic air filter cleaning or replacing, calling a local, qualified HVAC system professional for routine furnace service and equipment checks can assist make sure reliability and longevity, and in some cases avoid bigger concerns from establishing.
