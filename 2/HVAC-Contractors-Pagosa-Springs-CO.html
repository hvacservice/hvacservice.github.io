In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
