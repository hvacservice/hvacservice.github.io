<p>Due to the fact that things ran smoothly without any sound, I was extremely pleased in the start. Furthermore, I saw noticeable changes in my electrical power costs. After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is completion of the problem.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
