<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>First, know that a bulk of your central air and system cost will originate from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger houses. As you saw recently, you require an appropriately-sized unit for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down faster than anticipated or your regular monthly energy costs will skyrocket.

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
