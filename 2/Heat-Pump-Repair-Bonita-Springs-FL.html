<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
