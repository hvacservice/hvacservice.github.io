<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
