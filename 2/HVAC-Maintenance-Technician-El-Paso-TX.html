<h3>Gas Central Heating in El Paso Texas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
