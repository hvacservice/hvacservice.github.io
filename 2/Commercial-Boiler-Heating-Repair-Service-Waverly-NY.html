If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, identifying the right size of system for your house also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
