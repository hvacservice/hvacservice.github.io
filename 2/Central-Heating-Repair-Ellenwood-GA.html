<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
