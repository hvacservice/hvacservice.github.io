<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Heatpump are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle.
