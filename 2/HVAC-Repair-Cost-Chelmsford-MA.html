<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
