<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that a lot of Seattleites will just utilize moderately, however since heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine.
