If you didn't develop a heating and cooling service plan when you started your service, it's not far too late to develop one now, or to provide your initial plan an upgrade.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
