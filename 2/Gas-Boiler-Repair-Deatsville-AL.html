<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very important to preserving a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
