All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
