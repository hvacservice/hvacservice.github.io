<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
