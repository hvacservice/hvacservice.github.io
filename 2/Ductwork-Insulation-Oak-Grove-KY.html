The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Given that staff member earnings and other HR expenses will likely be the most significant cost for any HVAC company that works with staff, we're breaking this product out of the general discussion of monetary projections and into its own category. Having adequate funds to train and work with salespeople, specialists, and marketing, interactions and administrative staff is essential to the survival of your business.<p>
