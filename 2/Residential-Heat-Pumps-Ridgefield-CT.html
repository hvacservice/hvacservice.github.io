<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Ridgefield CT 06877</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens should look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures should not be undertaken until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
