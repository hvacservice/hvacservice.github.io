<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
