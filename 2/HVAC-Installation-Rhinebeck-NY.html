<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
