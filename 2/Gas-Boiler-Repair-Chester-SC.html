<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
