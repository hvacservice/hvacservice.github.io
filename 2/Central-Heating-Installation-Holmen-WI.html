One of the primary areas where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
