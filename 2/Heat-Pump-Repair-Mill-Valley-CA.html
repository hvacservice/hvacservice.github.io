Some effects may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the house.<p>

<p>Outside impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.
