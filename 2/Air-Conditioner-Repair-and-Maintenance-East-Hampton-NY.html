<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems in East Hampton NY</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is generally utilized in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
