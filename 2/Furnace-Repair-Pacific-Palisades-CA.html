<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Pacific Palisades California</h3>
<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been utilized commonly in a variety of structure construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant.

Today, asbestos is most frequently found in older houses, in pipeline and furnace insulation products, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating products, and flooring tiles.<p>

Airborne elements from normal household products and surfaces can result in formicary rust within your HVAC equipment.
