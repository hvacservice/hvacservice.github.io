<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Lake Elmo MN 55042</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in over half the workplace indoor air examinations it has actually performed. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
