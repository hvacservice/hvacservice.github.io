<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company in Wellington FL</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter season or summertime, having a working HVAC system is necessary. At Lowe's, we have a variety of heating and cooling systems-- from furnaces and heatpump to window a/c unit and portable air conditioning unit Plus, we provide cooling installation and heating installation by licensed professional independent installers.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
