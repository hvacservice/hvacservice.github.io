<h3>HVAC System in Fremont Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>
