<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
