<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
