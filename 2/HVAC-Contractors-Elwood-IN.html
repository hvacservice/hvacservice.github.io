<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home.

<p>Ac system producers normally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails.
