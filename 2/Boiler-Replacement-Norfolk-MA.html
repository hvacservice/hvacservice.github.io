<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Norfolk MA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
