<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Jackson Heights NY 11372</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment.

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
