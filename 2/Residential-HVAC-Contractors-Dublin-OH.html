<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
