<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
