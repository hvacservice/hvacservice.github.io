<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service.

<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being caught in concentrations and structures construct up inside.<p>
