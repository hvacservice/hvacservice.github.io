<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
