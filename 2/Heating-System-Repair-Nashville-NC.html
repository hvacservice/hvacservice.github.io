<p>A specific a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
