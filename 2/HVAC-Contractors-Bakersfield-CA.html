<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Bakersfield CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
