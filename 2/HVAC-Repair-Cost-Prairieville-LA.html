<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Prairieville LA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
