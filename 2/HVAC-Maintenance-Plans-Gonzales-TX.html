Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks.

<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Gonzales TX</h3>
<p>I was extremely happy in the beginning because things ran smoothly without any sound. Additionally, I saw noticeable changes in my electricity bills. After two years, things started to change. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it inspected and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous people.<p>

Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
