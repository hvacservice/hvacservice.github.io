<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less regular (but often more major) cases of individuals becoming ill after remaining in a specific building at a certain time.

Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can pollute a building's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future.
