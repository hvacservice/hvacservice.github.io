<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
