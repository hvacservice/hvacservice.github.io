Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
