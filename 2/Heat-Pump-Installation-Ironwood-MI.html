<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of a/c, a number of main elements need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Second of all, there should not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully released outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop greatly. It is extremely recommended to install the ac system units in easily accessible locations, for additional maintenance throughout operation.<p>
