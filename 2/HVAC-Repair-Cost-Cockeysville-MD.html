<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
