<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
