That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a few years back.<p>
