<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Swainsboro GA</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation organisation totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
