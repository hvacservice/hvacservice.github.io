<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
