<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the issue and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time.

In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
