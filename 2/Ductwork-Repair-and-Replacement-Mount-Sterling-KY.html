<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
