<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from a business or seller to do the installation. If you choose to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the air conditioning system.
