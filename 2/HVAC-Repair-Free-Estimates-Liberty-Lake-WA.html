All the wet hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining properly. A constraint in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are various locations a blockage can take place. Among the primary locations where obstructions start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
