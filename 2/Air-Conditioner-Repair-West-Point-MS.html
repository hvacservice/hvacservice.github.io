<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers in West Point MS</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Many people assume that HVAC specialists just repair cooling units and heating units. Nevertheless, there are other elements to the HVAC employee's task which are not so apparent.
