<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. There are several style techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump run with similar principles. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.
