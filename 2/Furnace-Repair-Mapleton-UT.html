<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
