<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
