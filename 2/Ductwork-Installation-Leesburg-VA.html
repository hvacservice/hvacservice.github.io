<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
