<p>We take a look at hints prior to we offer guidance to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are seldom utilized due to long-lasting corrosive concerns. Essentially all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, won't rust and comes in long lengths, which permit PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
