<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
