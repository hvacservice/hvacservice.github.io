<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, particularly in an older home. Depending on the kind of unit installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment may need special authorizations, and there is restricted versatility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>

Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was unbelievable, practical and helpful - his work was flawless! All of his assistants were diligent and courteous. The work site was left utterly cleared and cleaned.
