<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
