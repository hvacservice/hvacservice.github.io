<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
