<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
