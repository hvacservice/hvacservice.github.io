<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Falls Church VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the entire surface area of a flooring heats up the lower half of the space, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature level-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a various mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>
