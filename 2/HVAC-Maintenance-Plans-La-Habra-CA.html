<h3>AC Replacement in La Habra CA 90631</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
