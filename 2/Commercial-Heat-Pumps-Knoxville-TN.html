<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
