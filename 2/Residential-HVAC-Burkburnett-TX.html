<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
