<p>Due to the fact that things ran smoothly without any noise, I was very happy in the start. Additionally, I saw obvious changes in my electrical energy expenses. After 2 years, things began to change. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
