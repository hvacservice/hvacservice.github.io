Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried.
