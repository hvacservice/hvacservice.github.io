<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
