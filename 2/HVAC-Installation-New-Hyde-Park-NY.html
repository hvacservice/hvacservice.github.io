<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have actually learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
