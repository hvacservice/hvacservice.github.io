<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which generally includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>

However more complicated issues-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be proper.<p>
