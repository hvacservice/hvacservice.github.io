<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Monroe LA</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are wet or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and family plants.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
