<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was known how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other items.<p>

When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
