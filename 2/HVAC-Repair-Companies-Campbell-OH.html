<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Campbell OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation in Campbell OH 44405</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
