<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores. The primary risk of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More major than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a serious breathing illness.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
