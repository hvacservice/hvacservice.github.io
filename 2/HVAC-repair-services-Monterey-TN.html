<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
