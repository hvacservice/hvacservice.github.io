<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Omaha NE</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air conditioning system. In truth, you can even DIY, in spite of our strong suggestion not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air. Moreover, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra products and equipment.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
