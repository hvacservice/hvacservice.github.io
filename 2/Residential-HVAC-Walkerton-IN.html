<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter.

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Installation in Walkerton IN 46574</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
