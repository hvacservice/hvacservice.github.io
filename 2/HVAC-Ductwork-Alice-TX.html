And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies every month might be used to help you spend for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly costly to install, particularly in an older house. Depending upon the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust.

During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally include lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead products.

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
