<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
