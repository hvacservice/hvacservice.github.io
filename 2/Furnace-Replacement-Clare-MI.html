<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
