The large bulk of these units are multi-family or mixed-use, where a/c is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Since these activities generate big quantities of lead dust, people have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or housing department for ideas on which public companies or personal laboratories might have the ability to assist test your house for lead in paint.
