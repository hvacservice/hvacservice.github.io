They will search for signs of corrosion, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>

When the furnace stops working totally or simply won't keep your home warm, it can quickly become too cold for your family to stay in your home.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
