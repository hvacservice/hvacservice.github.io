The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
