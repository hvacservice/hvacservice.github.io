<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters.
