<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
