<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Angier NC</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
