Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
