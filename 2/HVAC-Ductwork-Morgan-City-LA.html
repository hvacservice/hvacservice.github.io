Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product.
