This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
