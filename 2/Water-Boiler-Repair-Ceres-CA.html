<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological contaminant. Biological contaminants in the home may include mold, bacteria, infections, termites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause contagious illness such as Legionnaires' disease.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up simply a couple of years back.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
