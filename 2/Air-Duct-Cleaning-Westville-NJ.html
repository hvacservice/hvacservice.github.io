<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard.

Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this.
