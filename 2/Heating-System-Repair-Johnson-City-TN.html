Only be concerned if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must contact a professional to check and repair the unit.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.

If  it doesn't, you've offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
