<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
