<p>Immediate effects might show up after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and usually short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
