<h3>Heating System Repair in Falmouth Maine</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
