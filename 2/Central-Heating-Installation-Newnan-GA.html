<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Newnan GA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
