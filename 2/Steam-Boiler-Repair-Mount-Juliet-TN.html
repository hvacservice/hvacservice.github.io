<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.

Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
