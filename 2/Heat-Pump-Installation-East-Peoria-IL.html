<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be linked to a device referred to as a geothermal desuperheater.

Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
