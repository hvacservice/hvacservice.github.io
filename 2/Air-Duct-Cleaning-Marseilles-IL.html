<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.  The so called trustworthy companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night attire.

How do I know. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called solutions and problems. 9 out of 10, I check are completely incorrect.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heater and located ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant however small modifications in his bid. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump since of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors.<p>
