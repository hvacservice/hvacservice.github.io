<p>We take a look at hints before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
