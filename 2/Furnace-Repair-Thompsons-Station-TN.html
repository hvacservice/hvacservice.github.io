<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To spot odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>

The structure type consisted of both commercial and residential. The majority of samples evaluated were tested favorable for fungis and germs.<p>
