<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
