<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
