<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
