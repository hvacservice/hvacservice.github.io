<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
