<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
