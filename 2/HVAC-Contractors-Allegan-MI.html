<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
