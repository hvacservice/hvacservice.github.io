<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly).

Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels.
