<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Salisbury MA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
