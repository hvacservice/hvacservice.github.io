<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Santa Fe Springs CA?</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
