<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
