<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.
