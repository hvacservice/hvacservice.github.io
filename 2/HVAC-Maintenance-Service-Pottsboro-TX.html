<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
