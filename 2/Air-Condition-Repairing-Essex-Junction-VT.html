<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
