<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
