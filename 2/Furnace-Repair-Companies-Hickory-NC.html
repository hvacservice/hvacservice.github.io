<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Hickory NC?</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofs, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues.

The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
