<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
