<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
