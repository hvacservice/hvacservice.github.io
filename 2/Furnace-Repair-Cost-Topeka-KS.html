The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
