<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
