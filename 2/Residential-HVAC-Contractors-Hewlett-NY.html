The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
