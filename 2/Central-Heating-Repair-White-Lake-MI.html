<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
