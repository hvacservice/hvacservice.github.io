<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
