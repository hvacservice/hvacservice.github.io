<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and comprehend.<p>
