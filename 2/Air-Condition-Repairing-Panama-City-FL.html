<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires dealt with by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, consider possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
