<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
