<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
