<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Truth About Anthony TX Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
