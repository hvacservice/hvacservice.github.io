<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in New Port Richey FL</h3>
<p>We are service specialists! As certified contractors and professionals in the field of heating and air-conditioning, we have the tools, the equipment, and the experience to keep your equipment running efficiently all year long. If it is emergency service that you need, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, we are available to help you! To help reduce service emergency situations, we offer service contracts to keep your comfort system performing at peak efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
