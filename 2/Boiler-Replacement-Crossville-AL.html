Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Examination of your furnace consists of a Health & Security Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leakages and polluted breathing air), checks the pilot security (explosion threat), checks the high limit (fire danger) and includes a visual inspection for other threats. In reality, our Safety Assessment consists of 10 different security checks of your system.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
