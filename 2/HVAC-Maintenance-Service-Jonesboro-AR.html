<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The primary threat of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More serious than the majority of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a severe respiratory illness.<p>

Gas furnaces cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.
