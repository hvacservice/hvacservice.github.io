<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Want to Know in Stanwood WA</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can include specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this problem because they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Moreover, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, signs up and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
