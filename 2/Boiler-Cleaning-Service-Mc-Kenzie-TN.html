High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure.
