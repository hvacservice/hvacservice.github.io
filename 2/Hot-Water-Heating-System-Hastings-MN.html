<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
