<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
