Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
