<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Snyder TX?</h3>
<p>When developing your new house a well-functioning Heating & cooling system is vital, as well as the air quality you breathe within. We have the experience and resources required to help from the planning phases through to the final installation. We use the latest software to help develop your ductwork system and utilize the greatest quality products in the building and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
