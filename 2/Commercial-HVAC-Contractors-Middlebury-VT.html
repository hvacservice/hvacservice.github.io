The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water locations).

The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
