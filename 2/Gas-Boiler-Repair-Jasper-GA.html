<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
