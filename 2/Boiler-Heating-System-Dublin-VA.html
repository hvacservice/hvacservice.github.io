<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
