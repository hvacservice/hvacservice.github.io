<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
