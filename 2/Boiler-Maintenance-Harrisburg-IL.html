<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
