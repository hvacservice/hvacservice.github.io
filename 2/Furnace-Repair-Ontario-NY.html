<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

If you change a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, consider anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin because they have the very best heat exchanger guarantees in the market on their top heating systems.<p>
