<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. Because they just partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the house, the efficiency of these devices is uncertain. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a dependable ways of minimizing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional information on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as hospitals and high-rise buildings, automobiles such as vehicles, trains, aircrafts, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
