We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch.

Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
