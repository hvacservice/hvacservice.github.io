<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
