<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Standish ME</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers direct exposure to pollutants during cooking.

Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
