<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
