<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
