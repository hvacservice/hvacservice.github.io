<h3>Home AC Repair in Southbridge Massachusetts</h3>

Radiant heat systems don't circulate air at all, which actually improves your indoor air quality by restricting your exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>

Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
