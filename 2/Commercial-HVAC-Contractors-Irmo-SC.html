<h3>Residential HVAC in Irmo South Carolina</h3>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
