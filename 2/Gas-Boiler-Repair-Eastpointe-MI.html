<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>

<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can impact a person's capability, comfort, and health to work.

<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Eastpointe MI Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow.
