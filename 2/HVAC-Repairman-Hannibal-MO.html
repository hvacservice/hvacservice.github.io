<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
