<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
