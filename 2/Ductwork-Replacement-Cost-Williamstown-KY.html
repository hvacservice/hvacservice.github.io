These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
