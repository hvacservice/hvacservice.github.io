<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Henderson NV</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is poorly lined up or used and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
