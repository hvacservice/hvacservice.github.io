<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and infants are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
