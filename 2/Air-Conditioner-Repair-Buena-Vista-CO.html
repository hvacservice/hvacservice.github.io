In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Invest in education and training: HVAC is not "rule of thumb" work, and no 2 homes are the very same. When technicians are correctly trained, they choose and set up efficient, safe equipment.
