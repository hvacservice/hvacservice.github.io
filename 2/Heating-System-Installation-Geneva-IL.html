<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>When a service compartmentalizes like this, it can even more increase efficiency, cut unneeded expenses, and increase revenues.
