<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
