<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of air conditioning system, a number of primary factors require to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
