<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
