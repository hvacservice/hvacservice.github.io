What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
