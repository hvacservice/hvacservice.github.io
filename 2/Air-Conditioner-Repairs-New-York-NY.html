<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that feature owning a high-demand, seasonal organisation. A thoroughly crafted company plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to manage those lulls and peaks so your profits remain healthy year-round.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
