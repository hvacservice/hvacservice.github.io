<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the problem area in looking over the costs. He fixed the problem in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered fair before he called back, knew what may have caused the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services offered.
