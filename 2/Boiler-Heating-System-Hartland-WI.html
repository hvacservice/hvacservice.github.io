<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
