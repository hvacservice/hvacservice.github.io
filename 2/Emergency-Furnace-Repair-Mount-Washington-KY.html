<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
