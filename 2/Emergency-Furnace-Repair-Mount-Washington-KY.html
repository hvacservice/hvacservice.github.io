You can avoid all these problems by making sure that your system is examined frequently, as this will prevent even small repairs from ending up being huge problems. Try to at least cleanup and analyze your furnace as frequently as the developer advises. Also, take severe precautions while trying to perform any do-it-yourself repairs to prevent health risks.

<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
