<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
