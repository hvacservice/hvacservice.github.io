<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they need to be positioned. Most frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals mostly stay seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending on what toxin you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensing unit appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
