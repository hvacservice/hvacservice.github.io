Local building regulations likely define the quantity (and often quality) of outdoor air that must be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
