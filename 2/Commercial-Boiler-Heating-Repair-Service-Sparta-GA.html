<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
