<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you might look for a heatpump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>

When they are handled in a method that produces dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a danger only.

This can result in the potential for substantial illness.<p>
