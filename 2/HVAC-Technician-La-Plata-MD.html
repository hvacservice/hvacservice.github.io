<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
