<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and solidify-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
