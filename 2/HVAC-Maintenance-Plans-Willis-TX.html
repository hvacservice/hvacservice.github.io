<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The majority of people know that outside air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can also have significant, damaging impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of toxins might be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
